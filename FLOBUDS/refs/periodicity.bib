	abstract = {Despite its low accuracy and consistency, growing degree days (GDD) has been widely used to approximate growing heat summation (GHS) for regional classification and phenological prediction. GDD is usually calculated from the mean of daily minimum and maximum temperatures (GDDmm) above a growing base temperature (Tgb). To determine approximation errors and accuracy, daily and cumulative GDDmm was compared to GDD based on daily average temperature (GDDavg), growing degree hours (GDH) based on hourly temperatures, and growing degree minutes (GDM) based on minute-by-minute temperatures. Finite error, due to the difference between measured and true temperatures above Tgb is large in GDDmm but is negligible in GDDavg, GDH, and GDM, depending only upon the number of measured temperatures used for daily approximation. Hidden negative error, due to the temperatures below Tgb when being averaged for approximation intervals larger than measuring interval, is large in GDDmm and GDDavg but is negligible in GDH and GDM. Both GDH and GDM improve GHS approximation accuracy over GDDmm or GDDavg by summation of multiple integration rectangles to reduce both finite and hidden negative errors. GDH is proposed as the standardized GHS approximation protocol, providing adequate accuracy and high precision independent upon Tgb while requiring simple data recording and processing.},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

	abstract = {Predicting the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change requires a variety of approaches, including the use of experiments, models, and surveys. Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity.},

@article{Downs:1980us,
	abstract = {{$[$}Phytotrons are the most complex form of controlled-environment facility. Artificially and naturally lighted controlled-environment rooms and cabinets are used in conjunction with incubators, seed germination chambers, roomettes, photoperiod rooms and mechanically-refrigerated greenhouses to provide a multiplicity of environmental conditions. Phytotrons are distinguished from the installation with a few plant growth chambers by the fact that phytotrons are operated in such a way that a wide range of several environmental factors can be studied simultaneously. Phytotrons have an operating staff of specialists to maintain the system and the experimental material. Scientists, therefore, concentrate on research rather than maintenance and operation of equipment. Phytotrons also make efficient use of controlled environment space, since they receive steady use without periods of inactivity and the downtime due to malfunctions that often characterize plant growth chambers. Although few, if any, technical problems in phytotron construction exist today, phytotron design suffers from the same lack of information that restricts performance of plant growth chambers; such as inadequate data on the physical characteristics of lighting systems and relative humidity control; especially those physical parameters that are dependent on, and influenced by, the biological material or by other environmental factors. Many excellent phytotrons have been constructed. Some, like those in Australia, France, New Zealand, and North Carolina, are general purpose phytotrons. Others are designed for particular plant species such as the rice research facility in the Philippines, or as in the USSR and Hungary, for specific research objectives like cold hardiness. The value of phytotrons in the general strategy of biological research is exemplified by the fact that one or more phytotrons ranging from 100 to over 600 m2 can be found in at least 19 countries. The latest of these facilities are located in Canada and the USSR. Phytotrons are used primarily to investigate how environment controls and modifies plant growth and development, but they are used also to complement and supplement field and greenhouse research in areas like plant breeding and introduction of new plant species and varieties. Synecology is built on a foundation of autecology and the key word in the definition of autecology is environment. Phytotrons, therefore, also play an important role in many phases of ecological research. Since plants can be grown and developed in phytotrons at rates, and with chemical compositions, that match definitions of "normal" they allow detailed study of the physiological and biochemical systems affected by climatic stress. Phytotrons are an efficient method of managing controlled-environment facilities, whether they are used as plant growth chambers to provide constant, reproducible conditions for biochemical studies or for research like simulation modeling which virtually requires simultaneous use of a wide range of several environmental factors. Despite the efficiency of operation and regardless of the manner in which they are used, however, the scientific results still depend on the quality of the investigators doing the research. /// Los fitotrones son la forma mas completa de "ambiente controlado" disponible. Cuartos y gabinetes de "ambiente controlado," artificial y naturalmente iluminados, son usados conjuntamente con incubadoras, c{\'a}maras para la germinaci{\'o}n de semillas, cuartos para el estudio de la duraci{\'o}n del fotoperiodo, e invernaderos mec{\'a}nicamente refrigerados para proveer las facilidades mas completas de "ambiente controlado." Los fititrones se distinguen de una simple instalaci{\'o}n de c{\'a}maras para el cultivo o crecimiento de plantas, por la condici{\'o}n de que son operados de tal manera que permiten que un gran rango de factores ambientales puedan ser estudiados simult{\'a}neamente. Los fitotrones poseen personal especialisado en el mantenimiento de todo el equipo, y material para experimentos necesario para cualquier tipo de estudio. De {\'e}sta manera, los cient{\'\i}ficos pueden concentrarse en el estudio y no en el cuidado y mantenimiento del equipo usado. Los fitotrones hacen uso cont{\'\i}nuo y eficiente de todas sus facilidades al no tener ningun per{\'\i}odo de inactividad o debido a mal funcionamiento que periodicamente caracteriza las c{\'a}maras de crecimiento de plantas. De todas manera, algunos, si los hay, problemas t{\'e}cnicos en la construccion de fitotron y dise{\~n}o, se deben a la falta de informaci{\'o}n que restringe el uso de las c{\'a}maras de cultivo de plantas, como es la informaci{\'o}n inadecuada de las caracter{\'\i}sticas f{\'\i}sicas del sistema de luz y los controles de humedad relativa, especialmente los par{\'a}metros f{\'\i}sicos que dependen o son influenciados por condiciones biol{\'o}gicas u otros factores ambientales. Excelentes fitotrones han sido constru{\'\i}dos, algunos como los de Australia, Francia, Nueva Zelandia, y Carolina del Norte fueron hechos para uso general. Otros fueron dise{\~n}ados para especies particulares de plantas como por ejemplo en las Filipinas, para el estudio del arroz, o como el de USSR y Hungr{\'\i}a para un objetivo espec{\'\i}fico, como es el estudio de la resistencia a baja temperaturas en plantas. El valor de fitotr{\'o}n en el estudio biol{\'o}gico, lo demuestra el hecho de que uno o m{\'a}s fitotrones con un espacio de 100 hasta m{\'a}s de 600 m2 est{\'a}n en uso en por lo menos 19 pa{\'\i}ses. Los {\'u}ltimos de {\'e}stos fueron constru{\'\i}dos en Canad{\'a}y USSR. Los fitotrones son usados principalmente para el estudio de como el "ambiente controlado" modifica o cambia el desarrolo y crecimiento de la planta, pero tambi{\'e}n son usados para complementar o suplementar experimentaci{\'o}n en invernaderos o el campo, en estudios sobre reproducci{\'o}n y en la introducci{\'o}n de nuevas variedades y especies. La sinecolog{\'\i}a se basa en autecolog{\'\i}a y la principal palabra en la definici{\'o}n de autecolog{\'\i}a es "ambiente." Los fitotrones juegan un rol important{\'\i}simo en varias fases de la experimentaci{\'o}n ecol{\'o}gica. Ya que las plantas pueden cultivarse y crecer en proporciones exactas, con proporciones qu{\'\i}micas que son id{\'e}nticas a las "normales," los fitotrones permiten el estudio detallado de los sistemas fisiol{\'o}gicos y bioqu{\'\i}micos los cuales son afectados por las presiones ambientales. Los fitotrones proveen un m{\'e}todo eficiente de manejar facilidades de ambiente controlado no obstante si son usados como c{\'a}maras de crecimiento, para mantener condiciones ambientales fijas (constantes) para estudio bioqu{\'\i}mico o para experimentaci{\'o}n en la imitaci{\'o}n de la naturaleza, que virtualmente requiere usos simult{\'a}neos de una gran variedad de condiciones ambientales. A{\'u}n teniendo en cuenta la eficiencia o la operaci{\'o}n o la manera como se usa, de todos maneras los resultados cient{\'\i}ficos dependen de la habilidad del estudiante o la persona que lo efect{\'u}a.{$]$}},

	n2 = {Abstract The relative timing of growth and reproduction is an important driver of plant fitness. For deciduous woody species in temperate regions, leaves and flowers both appear in the early spring, but the order and duration of these phenological events vary among species, populations and individuals. Researchers have long hypothesized that this variation in flower?leaf sequences (FLSs) may be important?affecting the reproduction, recruitment and survival of individuals. Furthermore, FLSs appear to be shifting with climate change; thus, anticipating the extent of these shifts may influence projections of how climate change impacts species' performance and reshapes forest communities. Predicting FLS shifts requires an improved understanding of how environmental variation dictates FLS patterns. To address this, we compared the phenological responses of flowers and developing leaves for 10 temperate woody species to varying levels of temperature and photoperiod in a lab experiment. Our experimental design allowed us to test competing hypotheses for how environmental cues determine FLS variation?specifically whether forcing (warm temperatures) alone drives variation or differential sensitivity to chilling (cool temperatures generally in the fall/winter) and/or photoperiod matter. Within species, we found that flower and leaf phenology responded with differential sensitivity to environmental cues, with differences in their response to chilling being the dominant driver of FLS variation. These differences between flowering and leaf responses were consistent across species, but because species differ in the order of phenological events in their FLSs (flowering-first versus leafing-first), differences between flower and leaf phenology will have contrasting impacts on FLS variation across species. Simple projections of FLS shifts with climate change showed large shifts in species that flower before leafing, with flower?leaf interphases substantially shortened. For wind-pollinated species, this shorter interphase would reduce the time period for efficient pollen transfer, and thus raises the possibility that wind-pollinated taxa may experience reproductive declines due to FLS shifts. Synthesis. Our study provides strong evidence that flower and leaf phenology responds with differential sensitivity to environmental variation. Because climate change will amplify variability in temperature across time and space, our findings suggest that FLS shifts may be large, but are likely to vary substantially among populations and species. Our analyses indicate that climate change will likely decrease flower?leaf interphases, especially in flowering-first species. FLS shifts are likely to affect fitness for some species more strongly than others, thereby impacting community structure and function as climate continues to change.},

	abstract = {Recommendations for near-natural plant growth under indoor conditions have been described without considering environmental fluctuations, which might have important consequences for researchers and plant producers when comparing results from indoor facilities with natural ecosystems or production. Previous authors proposed that differences in temperature, light quantity, and the lack of their variation are sources of deviations between indoor and outdoor experiments. Here, we investigated the effect of fluctuating light, temperature, and humidity in an indoor environment on plant performance. Seven plant species from different functional plant types were grown outdoors during summer and spring. The same species were then grown in indoor growth chambers under different scenarios of climate complexity in terms of fluctuations of temperature, air humidity, and light: (1) fixed night and day conditions, (2) daily sinusoidal changes, and (3) variable conditions tracking the climate records from the field trials. In each scenario, the average of the environmental variables was the same as in the respective field trial. Productivity-, gas exchange-, and leaf pigment-traits were measured in all plants at the end of the experiments. The plant trait responses were highly dependent on species and treatment, but general trends were observed. The variable condition yielded lower biomass compared to the fixed and sinusoidal conditions, together with a higher specific leaf area and increased chlorophyll concentrations. A principal component analysis (PCA) across all plant traits in response to climatic conditions suggested that at least a sinusoidal fluctuation is recommended for a more natural-like plant performance in indoor growth facilities. However, prevailing significant differences for several traits between field- and indoor-grown plants even under variable climates indicate that additional factors other than those controllable in standard phytotrons (e.g., wind speed and direction, leaf and soil temperature) can still significantly bias plant performance in indoor facilities.},

	n2 = {Summary The genetic basis of growth and development is often studied in constant laboratory environments; however, the environmental conditions that organisms experience in nature are often much more dynamic. We examined how daily temperature fluctuations, average temperature, day length and vernalization influence the flowering time of 59 genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with allelic perturbations known to affect flowering time. For a subset of genotypes, we also assessed treatment effects on morphology and growth. We identified 17 genotypes, many of which have high levels of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), that bolted dramatically earlier in fluctuating ? as opposed to constant ? warm temperatures (mean = 22$\,^{\circ}$C). This acceleration was not caused by transient VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-mediated vernalization, differential growth rates or exposure to high temperatures, and was not apparent when the average temperature was cool (mean = 12$\,^{\circ}$C). Further, in constant temperatures, contrary to physiological expectations, these genotypes flowered more rapidly in cool than in warm environments. Fluctuating temperatures often reversed these responses, restoring faster bolting in warm conditions. Independently of bolting time, warm fluctuating temperature profiles also caused morphological changes associated with shade avoidance or ?high-temperature? phenotypes. Our results suggest that previous studies have overestimated the effect of the floral repressor FLC on flowering time by using constant temperature laboratory conditions.},

	abstract = {Research on woody plant species highlights three major cues that shape spring phenological events: chilling, forcing and photoperiod. Increasing research on the phenological impacts of climate change has led to debate over whether chilling and/or photoperiod cues have slowed phenological responses to warming in recent years. Here we use a global meta-analysis of all published experiments to test the relative effects of these cues. Almost all species show strong responses to all three cues, with chilling being the strongest and photoperiod the weakest. Forecasts from our findings for Central Europe suggest that spring phenology will continue to advance, as stalling effects of chilling generally appear above 4 $\,^{\circ}$C warming in this region. Our results unify both sides of the debate over phenological cues: while all species may respond to all cues strongly in experimental conditions, in current environmental conditions the dominant signal of climate change is from increased forcing.},

	abstract = {In some gonochoristic species, sex is influenced not only by genotype at conception but also by the environment that offspring experience during early ontogeny (termed environmental sex determination or ESD). ESD is thought to be adaptive when seasonal variations in environmental conditions provide a sex-specific fitness advantage. In vertebrates, temperature is the most common determinant of sex, and seasonal variation in temperature serves as a temporal cue of environmental quality such as length of the growing season. Some environments, however, lack strong seasonal temperature fluctuations and other cues, particularly photoperiod, may provide a more reliable indicator of the environment offspring enter. We tested this hypothesis by rearing the offspring of the California grunion (Leuresthes tenuis, Ayres), which experiences low seasonal temperature variation in nature, under common garden conditions at three temperature and two photoperiod treatments. Our experiments revealed that both temperature and photoperiod significantly affected sex ratios in L. tenuis. More females were produced at cooler temperatures and longer day lengths, which is consistent with female-biased sex ratios early in the breeding season, and likely adaptive through increased female size and fecundity. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of photoperiod-dependent sex determination in a gonochoristic vertebrate.},

	abstract = {{Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 $\,^{\circ}$C/16 $\,^{\circ}$C and cool = 8 $\,^{\circ}$C/4 $\,^{\circ}$C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth--dormancy transition---including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange---within two provenances of white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.}},

What is often overlooked is how results from controlled conditions translate back to field situations. A meta-analysis showed that lab-grown plants had faster growth rates, higher nitrogen concentrations and different morphology. They remained smaller, however, because the lab plants had grown for a much shorter time. We compared glasshouse and growth chamber conditions with those in the field and found that the ratio between the daily amount of light and daily temperature (photothermal ratio) was consistently lower under controlled conditions. This may strongly affect a plant's source : sink ratio and hence its overall morphology and physiology. Plants in the field also grow at higher plant densities. A second meta-analysis showed that a doubling in density leads on average to 34{\%} smaller plants with strong negative effects on tiller or side-shoot formation but little effect on plant height. We found the r2 between lab and field phenotypic data to be rather modest (0.26). Based on these insights, we discuss various alternatives to facilitate the translation from lab results to the field, including several options to apply growth regimes closer to field conditions.},

Anthropogenic climate change, however, may alter historical weather patterns and seasonal cues. Many studies have evaluated thermal effects on life history traits, but fewer have also examined photoperiodic effects. Because the degree of seasonal cue varies across latitude, we examine developmental plasticity in Drosophila subobscura populations sampled from latitudinal clines across Europe and North America. We examine the interaction between temperature and photoperiod on insect development time, adult survival, and fitness using a two by two factorial design with long (16L:8D) and short days (8L:16D) at high (23$\,^{\circ}$C) and low temperatures (15$\,^{\circ}$C).. We find that development time is dependent on both temperature and photoperiod but the low temperature/long day treatment revealed a dramatic and unexpected 4.5 day delay in eclosion. Fitness, estimated by the intrinsic rate of increase (r), showed a significant increase in response to temperature and a decrease in response to day length, and an interaction such that long-days reduced the effects of temperature. Additionally, cooler temperatures increased lifespan, and long-days reduced survivorship; temperature and day length interacted such that lifespan is relatively shorter in seasonally mismatched (long-cool, short-warm) conditions compared to matched conditions.

	n2 = {Abstract Introduction Organisms use environmental cues to match their phenotype with the future availability of resources and environmental conditions. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature along latitudes can be used by organisms to predict seasonal changes. While the role of temperature variation on the induction of plastic and seasonal responses is well established, the importance of photoperiod for predicting seasonal changes is less explored. Materials and methods Here we studied changes in life-history and thermal stress resistance traits in Drosophila subobscura in response to variation in photoperiod (6:18, 12:12 and 18:6 light:dark cycles) mimicking seasonal variations in day length. The populations of D. subobscura were collected from five locations along a latitudinal gradient (from North Africa and Europe). These populations were exposed to different photoperiods for two generations, whereafter egg-to-adult viability, productivity, dry body weight, thermal tolerance, and starvation resistance were assessed. Results We found strong effects of photoperiod, origin of populations, and their interactions on life-history and stress resistance traits. Thermal resistance varied between the populations and the effect of photoperiod depended on the trait and the method applied for the assessment of thermal resistance. Perspectives Our results show a strong effect of the origin of population and photoperiod on a range of fitness-related traits and provide evidence for local adaptation to environmental cues (photoperiod by population interaction). The findings emphasize an important and often neglected role of photoperiod in studies on thermal resistance and suggest that cues induced by photoperiod may provide some buffer enabling populations to cope with a more variable and unpredictable future climate.},

	abstract = {The duration of the vegetative phase (i.e. days from sowing to panicle initiation) in sorghum {$[$}Sorghum bicolor(L.) Moench{$]$} is affected by photoperiod and temperature. Plants of several contrasting genotypes of sorghum were grown in controlled-environment growth cabinets with either synchronous or asynchronous photoperiods and thermoperiods. Apical development was recorded. Diurnal asynchrony between photoperiod and thermoperiod reduced durations to panicle initiation when the temperature warmed after lights went on and cooled after lights went off, but increased these durations when the temperature warmed before lights went on and cooled before lights went off. These effects were shown in the maturity lines 60M and SM100 and also in the USA cv. RS610 and the Sudanese landrace IS22365, but their magnitude varied with genotype, photothermal regime, and the degree of asynchrony. The greatest effect was detected in IS22365 grown at 30/21 $\,^{\circ}$C (12 h/12 h) with a 12 h d−1photoperiod when the temperature warmed 2.5 h before lights went on and cooled 2.5 h before lights went off, when the duration from sowing to panicle initiation was 69 d compared with 37 d in the control (synchronous photoperiod and thermoperiod in each diurnal cycle). Reciprocal transfers of plants of IS22365 between short and long days revealed that asynchrony principally affected the duration of the photoperiod-insensitive pre-inductive phase of development; i.e. asynchrony affected the time (age) at which the plants were first able to respond to photoperiod. In that investigation in controlled-environment growth chambers, the subsequent photoperiod-sensitive inductive phase continued until panicle initiation. Subsequent reciprocal transfer experiments in controlled-environment glasshouses in four different alternating temperature regimes employed synchronous photoperiods and thermoperiods in short (11 h) days with temperature warming 1.5 h after the beginning of the day in long (12.5 h) days. In those investigations, photoperiod sensitivity ended some time before (2.5--8.1 d, mean 5.7 d) panicle initiation in IS22365, Naga White and Seredo. Moreover, whereas the duration of the photoperiod-insensitive pre-inductive phase was affected by temperature, the durations of the photoperiod-sensitive inductive and the photoperiod-insensitive post-inductive phases were not.},

The higher advancements of bud break and shorter times required to complete the phenological phases occurred with daytime warming. Seedlings responded to night-time warming, but still with less advancement of bud break than under daytime warming. No advancement was observed when night-time warming was associated with a daytime cooling. The effect of the treatments was uniform across provenances. Our observations realized under controlled conditions allowed to experimentally demonstrate that bud break can advance under night-time warming, but to a lesser extent than under daytime warming. Prediction models using daily timescales could neglect the diverging influence of asymmetric warming and should be recalibrated for higher temporal resolutions.},

	abstract = {{Soybean {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] genotypes have been identified that
   show differential sensitivity to light quality. The use of different
   lamp types emitting light of different quality changed flowering
   responses to long days. The objective of this study was to investigate
   the flowering response of three photoperiod-sensitivity loci to long
   days of various light qualities. `Harosoy' near-isogenic lines were
   grown under 20-h-long days of different light qualities, as measured by
   the bichromatic ratio of red to far-red quanta (R:FR), and under light
   quality gradients. Generally, the photoperiodic response was greater,
   i.e., later flowering, with decreased R:FR. The E(1) allele was most
   sensitive to light quality and required an R:FR approximating that of
   natural daylight for response to long days. The E(3) allele was the
   least sensitive, and the E(4) allele showed intermediate sensitivity to
   light quality. The earliest-flowering near-isogenic line (e(1) e(3)
   e(4)), previously found to be insensitive to long day length, showed
   sensitivity to long days of low R:FR light. Long days of high R:FR light
   were not effective in delaying flowering for some genotypes. Sensing the
   R:FR ratio is the function of phytochrome in light-grown plants. The
   three loci studied in this work responded differentially to changes in
   R:FR, suggesting either a close relationship between soybean E alleles
   and phytochrome or the possibility that some photoperiod-sensitivity
   loci are part of the phytochrome family of genes.}},

	abstract = {{An LED spectrum containing blue light advanced bud burst in branches of
   Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Quercus robur compared with a
   spectrum without blue light in a controlled environment.
   During spring, utilising multiple cues allow tree species from temperate
   and boreal regions to coordinate their bud burst and leaf out, at the
   right moment to capitalise on favourable conditions for photosynthesis.
   Whilst the effect of blue light (400-500 nm) has been shown to increase
   percentage bud burst of axillary shoots of Rosa sp., the effects of blue
   light on spring-time bud burst of deciduous tree species have not
   previously been reported. We tested the hypotheses that blue light would
   advance spring bud burst in tree species, and that late-successional
   species would respond more than early-successional species, whose bud
   burst is primarily determined by temperature. The bud development of
   Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, and Quercus robur branches, cut from
   dormant trees, was monitored under two light treatments of equal
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and temperature,
   either with or without blue light, under controlled environmental
   conditions. In the presence of blue light, the mean time required to
   reach 50\% bud burst was reduced by 3.3 days in Betula pendula, 6 days
   in Alnus glutinosa, and 6.3 days in Quercus robur. This result
   highlights the potential of the blue region of the solar spectrum to be
   used as an extra cue that could help plants to regulate their spring
   phenology, alongside photoperiod and temperature. Understanding how
   plants combine photoreceptor-mediated cues with other environmental cues
   such as temperature to control phenology is essential if we are to
   accurately predict how tree species might respond to climate change.}},

However, a temperature increase in winter may be associated with delayed development when species' chilling requirements are not fulfilled. Furthermore, photosensitivity is supposed to interfere with temperature triggers. To date, neither the relative importance nor possible interactions of these three factors have been elucidated. In this study, we present a multispecies climate chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling and photoperiod on the spring phenology of 36 woody species. Several hypotheses regarding their variation with species traits (successional strategy, floristic status, climate of their native range) were tested. Long photoperiods advanced budburst for one-third of the studied species, but magnitudes of these effects were generally minor. In contrast to prior hypotheses, photosensitive responses were not restricted to climax or oceanic species. Increased chilling length advanced budburst for almost all species; its effect greatly exceeding that of photoperiod. Moreover, we suggest that photosensitivity and chilling effects have to be rigorously disentangled, as the response to photoperiod was restricted to individuals that had not been fully chilled. The results indicate that temperature requirements and successional strategy are linked, with climax species having higher chilling and forcing requirements than pioneer species. Temperature requirements of invasive species closely matched those of native species, suggesting that high phenological concordance is a prerequisite for successful establishment. Lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in budburst but also caused substantial changes in the chronological order of species' budburst. The results reveal that increased winter temperatures might impact forest ecosystems more than formerly assumed. Species with lower chilling requirements, such as pioneer or invasive species, might profit from warming winters, if late spring frost events would in parallel occur earlier.},

Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology ? temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod ? generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst (?15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout (?19.1 and ?11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

Virtually all biological phenomena{\textemdash}from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes{\textemdash}have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

	abstract = {{Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and
   currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on
   phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these
   events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But
   phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own
   perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing
   and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the
   periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing
   programmes (e. g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes
   underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need
   to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In
   order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate
   these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary
   and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize
   different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already
   been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting
   the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to
   better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change

@article{Primack2015,
	abstract = {{Background and Aims Climate change is advancing the leaf-out times of
   many plant species and mostly extending the growing season in temperate
   ecosystems. Laboratory experiments using twig cuttings from woody plant
   species present an affordable, easily replicated approach to investigate
   the relative importance of factors such as winter chilling, photoperiod,
   spring warming and frost tolerance on the leafing-out times of plant
   communities. This Viewpoint article demonstrates how the results of
   these experiments deepen our understanding beyond what is possible via
   analyses of remote sensing and field observation data, and can be used
   to improve climate change forecasts of shifts in phenology, ecosystem
   processes and ecological interactions.
   Scope The twig method involves cutting dormant twigs from trees, shrubs
   and vines on a single date or at intervals over the course of the winter
   and early spring, placing them in containers of water in controlled
   environments, and regularly recording leaf-out, flowering or other
   phenomena. Prior to or following leaf-out or flowering, twigs may be
   assigned to treatment groups for experiments involving temperature,
   photoperiod, frost, humidity and more. Recent studies using these
   methods have shown that winter chilling requirements and spring warming
   strongly affect leaf-out and flowering times of temperate trees and
   shrubs, whereas photoperiod requirements are less important than
   previously thought for most species. Invasive plant species have weaker
   winter chilling requirements than native species in temperate
   ecosystems, and species that leaf-out early in the season have greater
   frost tolerance than later leafing species.
   Conclusions This methodology could be extended to investigate additional
   drivers of leaf-out phenology, leaf senescence in the autumn, and other
   phenomena, and could be a useful tool for education and outreach.
   Additional ecosystems, such as boreal, southern hemisphere and
   sub-tropical forests, could also be investigated using dormant twigs to
   determine the drivers of leaf-out times and how these ecosystems will be
   affected by climate change.}},

@article{Menzel2006,
	abstract = {{Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical
   and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a
   consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators
   is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded
   dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus,
   numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events
   for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season.
   However, published single-site or single-species studies are
   particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly
   reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or
   meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for
   changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We
   used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than
   125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21
   European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all
   leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly)
   and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf
   colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published
   results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or
   publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5
   days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series
   undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to
   temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by
   2.5 days degrees C(-1), delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day
   degrees C(-1)). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently
   matches measured national warming across 19 European countries
   (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).}},

@article{Chuine2001,
	abstract = {{Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant
   distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation.
   However, very few models are able to predict species distribution
   accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate
   change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree
   species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological
   processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as
   a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power
   when tested against present distributions of two North American species
   - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the
   fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche.
   Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range
   and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global
   warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.}},

@article{Piao2007,
	abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},
