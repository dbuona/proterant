We investigated the effects of asymmetric experimental warming on plant phenology by testing the hypothesis that daytime warming is more effective in advancing bud break than night-time warming. Bud break was monitored daily in Picea mariana seedlings belonging to 20 provenances from Eastern Canada and subjected to daytime and night-time warming in growth chambers at temperatures varying between 8 and 16 $\,^{\circ}$C. The higher advancements of bud break and shorter times required to complete the phenological phases occurred with daytime warming. Seedlings responded to night-time warming, but still with less advancement of bud break than under daytime warming. No advancement was observed when night-time warming was associated with a daytime cooling. The effect of the treatments was uniform across provenances. Our observations realized under controlled conditions allowed to experimentally demonstrate that bud break can advance under night-time warming, but to a lesser extent than under daytime warming. Prediction models using daily timescales could neglect the diverging influence of asymmetric warming and should be recalibrated for higher temporal resolutions.},

	Abstract = {{Diurnal temperature fluctuation interacts with light quality and
   photoperiod to affect plant stem elongation. Stem cell elongation but
   not division increases as day temperature increases relative to night
   temperature and as day length increases for many species. The effect of
   diurnal temperature fluctuation and photoperiod on stem elongation are
   mediated via phytochrome where stem elongation increases as \%P-fr
   decreases. The basis for diurnal temperature and photoperiod effects on
   stem elongation is associated with temperature fluctuation when stimuli
   occur during the period of most rapid stem elongation during a 24- hour
   cycle, i.e., the end of the scotoperiod and beginning of the
   photoperiod. The basis for thigmotropic inhibition of stem elongation is
   associated with endogenous stimulation of ethylene synthesis.
   Application of this information to commercial plant production and
   potential future research directions will be discussed.}},

	Abstract = {{Soybean {[}Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] genotypes have been identified that
   show differential sensitivity to light quality. The use of different
   lamp types emitting light of different quality changed flowering
   responses to long days. The objective of this study was to investigate
   the flowering response of three photoperiod-sensitivity loci to long
   days of various light qualities. `Harosoy' near-isogenic lines were
   grown under 20-h-long days of different light qualities, as measured by
   the bichromatic ratio of red to far-red quanta (R:FR), and under light
   quality gradients. Generally, the photoperiodic response was greater,
   i.e., later flowering, with decreased R:FR. The E(1) allele was most
   sensitive to light quality and required an R:FR approximating that of
   natural daylight for response to long days. The E(3) allele was the
   least sensitive, and the E(4) allele showed intermediate sensitivity to
   light quality. The earliest-flowering near-isogenic line (e(1) e(3)
   e(4)), previously found to be insensitive to long day length, showed
   sensitivity to long days of low R:FR light. Long days of high R:FR light
   were not effective in delaying flowering for some genotypes. Sensing the
   R:FR ratio is the function of phytochrome in light-grown plants. The
   three loci studied in this work responded differentially to changes in
   R:FR, suggesting either a close relationship between soybean E alleles
   and phytochrome or the possibility that some photoperiod-sensitivity
   loci are part of the phytochrome family of genes.}},

	Abstract = {{An LED spectrum containing blue light advanced bud burst in branches of
   Betula pendula, Alnus glutinosa and Quercus robur compared with a
   spectrum without blue light in a controlled environment.
   During spring, utilising multiple cues allow tree species from temperate
   and boreal regions to coordinate their bud burst and leaf out, at the
   right moment to capitalise on favourable conditions for photosynthesis.
   Whilst the effect of blue light (400-500 nm) has been shown to increase
   percentage bud burst of axillary shoots of Rosa sp., the effects of blue
   light on spring-time bud burst of deciduous tree species have not
   previously been reported. We tested the hypotheses that blue light would
   advance spring bud burst in tree species, and that late-successional
   species would respond more than early-successional species, whose bud
   burst is primarily determined by temperature. The bud development of
   Alnus glutinosa, Betula pendula, and Quercus robur branches, cut from
   dormant trees, was monitored under two light treatments of equal
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and temperature,
   either with or without blue light, under controlled environmental
   conditions. In the presence of blue light, the mean time required to
   reach 50\% bud burst was reduced by 3.3 days in Betula pendula, 6 days
   in Alnus glutinosa, and 6.3 days in Quercus robur. This result
   highlights the potential of the blue region of the solar spectrum to be
   used as an extra cue that could help plants to regulate their spring
   phenology, alongside photoperiod and temperature. Understanding how
   plants combine photoreceptor-mediated cues with other environmental cues
   such as temperature to control phenology is essential if we are to
   accurately predict how tree species might respond to climate change.}},

	N2 = {Abstract It is well known that increased spring temperatures cause earlier onset dates of leaf unfolding and flowering. However, a temperature increase in winter may be associated with delayed development when species' chilling requirements are not fulfilled. Furthermore, photosensitivity is supposed to interfere with temperature triggers. To date, neither the relative importance nor possible interactions of these three factors have been elucidated. In this study, we present a multispecies climate chamber experiment to test the effects of chilling and photoperiod on the spring phenology of 36 woody species. Several hypotheses regarding their variation with species traits (successional strategy, floristic status, climate of their native range) were tested. Long photoperiods advanced budburst for one-third of the studied species, but magnitudes of these effects were generally minor. In contrast to prior hypotheses, photosensitive responses were not restricted to climax or oceanic species. Increased chilling length advanced budburst for almost all species; its effect greatly exceeding that of photoperiod. Moreover, we suggest that photosensitivity and chilling effects have to be rigorously disentangled, as the response to photoperiod was restricted to individuals that had not been fully chilled. The results indicate that temperature requirements and successional strategy are linked, with climax species having higher chilling and forcing requirements than pioneer species. Temperature requirements of invasive species closely matched those of native species, suggesting that high phenological concordance is a prerequisite for successful establishment. Lack of chilling not only led to a considerable delay in budburst but also caused substantial changes in the chronological order of species' budburst. The results reveal that increased winter temperatures might impact forest ecosystems more than formerly assumed. Species with lower chilling requirements, such as pioneer or invasive species, might profit from warming winters, if late spring frost events would in parallel occur earlier.},

Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology ? temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod ? generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst (?15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout (?19.1 and ?11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

	Abstract = {Phenology affects nearly all aspects of ecology and evolution. Virtually all biological phenomena{\textemdash}from individual physiology to interspecific relationships to global nutrient fluxes{\textemdash}have annual cycles and are influenced by the timing of abiotic events. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in this topic, as an increasing number of studies document phenological responses to climate change. Much recent research has addressed the genetic controls on phenology, modelling techniques and ecosystem-level and evolutionary consequences of phenological change. To date, however, these efforts have tended to proceed independently. Here, we bring together some of these disparate lines of inquiry to clarify vocabulary, facilitate comparisons among habitat types and promote the integration of ideas and methodologies across different disciplines and scales. We discuss the relationship between phenology and life history, the distinction between organismal- and population-level perspectives on phenology and the influence of phenology on evolutionary processes, communities and ecosystems. Future work should focus on linking ecological and physiological aspects of phenology, understanding the demographic effects of phenological change and explicitly accounting for seasonality and phenology in forecasts of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change.},

	Abstract = {{Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and
   currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on
   phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these
   events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But
   phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own
   perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing
   and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the
   periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing
   programmes (e. g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes
   underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need
   to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In
   order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate
   these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary
   and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize
   different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already
   been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting
   the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to
   better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change
   impacts on phenology.}},

@article{Primack2015,
	Abstract = {{Background and Aims Climate change is advancing the leaf-out times of
   many plant species and mostly extending the growing season in temperate
   ecosystems. Laboratory experiments using twig cuttings from woody plant
   species present an affordable, easily replicated approach to investigate
   the relative importance of factors such as winter chilling, photoperiod,
   spring warming and frost tolerance on the leafing-out times of plant
   communities. This Viewpoint article demonstrates how the results of
   these experiments deepen our understanding beyond what is possible via
   analyses of remote sensing and field observation data, and can be used
   to improve climate change forecasts of shifts in phenology, ecosystem
   processes and ecological interactions.
   Scope The twig method involves cutting dormant twigs from trees, shrubs
   and vines on a single date or at intervals over the course of the winter
   and early spring, placing them in containers of water in controlled
   environments, and regularly recording leaf-out, flowering or other
   phenomena. Prior to or following leaf-out or flowering, twigs may be
   assigned to treatment groups for experiments involving temperature,
   photoperiod, frost, humidity and more. Recent studies using these
   methods have shown that winter chilling requirements and spring warming
   strongly affect leaf-out and flowering times of temperate trees and
   shrubs, whereas photoperiod requirements are less important than
   previously thought for most species. Invasive plant species have weaker
   winter chilling requirements than native species in temperate
   ecosystems, and species that leaf-out early in the season have greater
   frost tolerance than later leafing species.
   Conclusions This methodology could be extended to investigate additional
   drivers of leaf-out phenology, leaf senescence in the autumn, and other
   phenomena, and could be a useful tool for education and outreach.
   Additional ecosystems, such as boreal, southern hemisphere and
   sub-tropical forests, could also be investigated using dormant twigs to
   determine the drivers of leaf-out times and how these ecosystems will be
   affected by climate change.}},

@article{Menzel2006,
	Abstract = {{Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical
   and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a
   consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators
   is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded
   dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus,
   numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events
   for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season.
   However, published single-site or single-species studies are
   particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly
   reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or
   meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for
   changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We
   used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than
   125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21
   European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all
   leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly)
   and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf
   colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published
   results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or
   publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5
   days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series
   undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to
   temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by
   2.5 days degrees C(-1), delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day
   degrees C(-1)). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently
   matches measured national warming across 19 European countries
   (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).}},

	Abstract = {{Global warming is expected to have a major impact on plant
   distributions, an issue of key importance in biological conservation.
   However, very few models are able to predict species distribution
   accurately, although we know species respond individually to climate
   change. Here we show, using a process-based model (PHENOFIT), that tree
   species distributions can be predicted precisely if the biological
   processes of survival and reproductive success only are incorporated as
   a function of phenology. These predictions showed great predictive power
   when tested against present distributions of two North American species
   - quaking aspen and sugar maple - indicating that on a broad scale, the
   fundamental niche of trees coincides with their realized niche.
   Phenology is shown here to be a major determinant of plant species range
   and should therefore be used to assess the consequences of global
   warming on plant distributions, and the spread of alien plant species.}},

@article{Piao2007,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},
