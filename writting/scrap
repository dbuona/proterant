 It follow that if for any given year, leaf survival is more critical that flower, more resources wouldbe divirted to protecting leaves if the risk of exposure to late season frost was equal in both tissues. The general concensus is that frost resistance is higher in leaf tissue than floral tissue \citep{Saki1987,Inouye2002,CaraDonna2015}, however other studies have shown other trends pattern\citep{}. We we cannot say whether higher frost resistance is neccisarily indicative of more valuable tissue, or rather a reflection of phenological differences
