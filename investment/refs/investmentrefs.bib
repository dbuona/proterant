	abstract = {{Much of the literature on foraging behaviour in bees focuses on what
   they learn after they have had rewarded experience with flowers. This
   review focuses on how honeybees and bumblebees are drawn to candidate
   food sources in the first place: the foundation on which learning is
   built. Prior to rewarded foraging experience, flower-na < ve bumblebees
   and honeybees rely heavily on visual cues to discover their first
   flower. This review lists methodological issues that surround the study
   of flower-na < ve behaviour and describes technological advances. The
   role of distinct visual properties of flowers in attracting bees is
   considered: colour, floral size, patterning and social cues. The
   research reviewed is multi-disciplinary and takes the perspectives of
   both the bees and the plants they visit. Several avenues for future
   research are proposed.}},

@article{Bukovac:2017aa,
	abstract = {Flowers are often viewed by bee pollinators against a variety of different backgrounds. On the Australian continent, backgrounds are very diverse and include surface examples of all major geological stages of the Earth's history, which have been present during the entire evolutionary period of Angiosperms. Flower signals in Australia are also representative of typical worldwide evolutionary spectral adaptations that enable successful pollination. We measured the spectral properties of 581 natural surfaces, including rocks, sand, green leaves, and dry plant materials, sampled from tropical Cairns through to the southern tip of mainland Australia. We modelled in a hexagon colour space, how interactions between background spectra and flower-like colour stimuli affect reliable discrimination and detection in bee pollinators. We calculated the extent to which a given locus would be conflated with the loci of a different flower-colour stimulus using empirically determined colour discrimination regions for bee vision. Our results reveal that whilst colour signals are robust in homogeneous background viewing conditions, there could be significant pressure on plant flowers to evolve saliently-different colours to overcome background spectral noise. We thus show that perceptual noise has a large influence on how colour information can be used in natural conditions.},

@article{Forrest:2009aa,
	abstract = {Flowers adapted for hummingbird pollination are typically red. This correlation is usually explained by the assertion that nectar- or pollen-stealing bees are ``blind''to red flowers. However, laboratory studies have shown that bees are capable of locating artificial red flowers and often show no innate preference for blue over red. We hypothesised that these findings might be artefacts of the simplified laboratory environment. Using bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) that had been trained to visit red and blue artificial flowers, we tested whether colour preference was influenced by complexity of the background on which they were foraging. Many bees were indifferent to flower colour when tested using a uniform green background like those commonly used in laboratory studies, but all bees showed strong colour preferences (usually for blue) when flowers were presented against a photograph of real foliage. Overall, preference for blue flowers was significantly greater on the more realistic, complex background. These results support the notion that the red of ``hummingbird syndrome''flowers can function to reduce bee visits despite the ability of bees to detect red and highlight the need to consider context when drawing inferences about pollinator preferences from laboratory data.},

@article{Spaethe3898,
	abstract = {In optimal foraging theory, search time is a key variable defining the value of a prey type. But the sensory-perceptual processes that constrain the search for food have rarely been considered. Here we evaluate the flight behavior of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) searching for artificial flowers of various sizes and colors. When flowers were large, search times correlated well with the color contrast of the targets with their green foliage-type background, as predicted by a model of color opponent coding using inputs from the bees{\textquoteright} UV, blue, and green receptors. Targets that made poor color contrast with their backdrop, such as white, UV-reflecting ones, or red flowers, took longest to detect, even though brightness contrast with the background was pronounced. When searching for small targets, bees changed their strategy in several ways. They flew significantly slower and closer to the ground, so increasing the minimum detectable area subtended by an object on the ground. In addition, they used a different neuronal channel for flower detection. Instead of color contrast, they used only the green receptor signal for detection. We relate these findings to temporal and spatial limitations of different neuronal channels involved in stimulus detection and recognition. Thus, foraging speed may not be limited only by factors such as prey density, flight energetics, and scramble competition. Our results show that understanding the behavioral ecology of foraging can substantially gain from knowledge about mechanisms of visual information processing.},

@article{Rivest:2017aa,
	abstract = {Red flowers are a defining character of the bird-pollination syndrome. Birds do not, however, innately prefer red, suggesting that rather than attracting birds, red flowers may serve to exclude other visitors (e.g., bumblebees). Bees are sometimes considered ``blind''to red, but studies have in fact documented both blue and red preferences in various bee species. These mixed results may be an effect of overly simplistic lab settings. We hypothesized that bees might readily locate red flowers in a simple laboratory environment, but struggle to find the same flowers in a complex, foliated setting. We tested the effects of environmental complexity on visitation to red and blue artificial flowers and on the foraging rate of captive worker bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bees made significantly fewer visits to red flowers when foraging in a complex environment with artificial green foliage, suggesting that red becomes harder to locate in this context than in a simple, leafless environment. Bees also foraged more slowly, on average, in the complex environment, although the difference was apparent only among experienced bees. Our findings provide a possible explanation for previous laboratory tests finding no colour preference in bumblebees. This ``contextual colour-blindness''of bees supports the hypothesis that red evolved as a mechanism for plants to avoid visitation by bees, favouring bird pollination instead.},

	n2 = {ABSTRACT The present article reviews recent and older literature on the spatial parameters that flowers display, as well as on the capacities of anthophilous insects to perceive and use these parameters for optimizing their foraging success. Although co‐evolution of plants and pollinators has frequently been discussed with respect to floral colours and insect colour vision, it has rarely been assessed with respect to insect spatial vision and spatial floral cues, such as shape, pattern, size, contrast, symmetry, spatial frequency, contour density and orientation of contours. This review is an attempt to fill this gap. From experimental findings and observations on both flowers and insects, we arrive at the conclusion that all of the spatial and spatio‐temporal parameters that flowers offer are relevant to the foraging task and are tuned to the insect's visual capacities and visually guided behaviour. We try, in addition, to indicate that temporal cues are closely related to spatial cues, and must therefore be included when flower--pollinator interactions are examined. We include results that show that colour vision and spatial vision have diverged over the course of evolution, particularly regarding the processing of spatio‐temporal information, but that colour vision plays a role in the processing of spatial cues that are independent of temporal parameters. By presenting this review we hope to contribute to closer collaboration among scientists working in the vast fields of botany, ecology, evolution, ethology and sensory physiology.},

@article{DEBUSSCHE:2004aa,
	abstract = {The phenology and morphology of Mediterranean plants are constrained by drought in summer and cold temperatures in winter. In this study we examine how climatic factors and phylogenetic constraints have shaped variation in the phenology and morphology of 17 species of the genus Cyclamen cultivated in uniform garden conditions. We quantify the extent to which traits differ among subgenera and thus represent conserved traits within evolutionary lineages. We also explore whether leaf, flowering and seed-release phenology are correlated among species, and thus whether variation in flowering phenology results from selection on dispersal phenology. Our results show a significant influence of subgenus membership on leaf and flowering phenology but not on morphological traits or the timing of seed release. Among-species variation in foliage height, leaf size and seed mass (but not in floral traits) is correlated with chromosome number. Leaf traits show that species with a shorter vegetative period have a higher capacity for resource acquisition. Major phenological shifts, i.e. spring vs. autumn flowering and a decoupling of leaf and flower phenology in autumnal flowering species, thus occurred prior to the diversification of species in each subgenus and not as a response to selection on dispersal timing. Leaf and flowering phenology illustrate a gradient of strategies from autumn flowering in the absence of leaves (hysteranthous species) to spring flowering with fully developed foliage (synanthous species). In the former, flowering is uncoupled from resource acquisition by simultaneous photosynthesis, indicative that hysteranthy is a response to temporal unpredictability in the onset of rain after the summer drought. Our results support the idea that whereas leaf development is controlled primarily by moisture availability and secondarily by temperature, flowering is temperature dependent, above a minimum moisture threshold.},

We contrasted the roles of floral display size and flower color in attracting three bee species and determined the relationships between plant attractiveness (number of pollinator visits) and seed set for each bee species. METHODS: We recorded pollinator visits to plants, measured plant traits, and quantified plant reproductive success. A zero-inflated Poisson regression model indicated plant traits associated with pollinator attraction. It identified traits that increased the number of bee visits and traits that increased the probability of a plant not receiving any visits. Different components of floral display size were examined and two models of flower color contrasted. Relationships between plant attractiveness and seed set were determined using regression analyses. KEY RESULTS: Plants with more racemes received more bee visits from all three bee species. Plants with few racemes were more likely not to receive any bee visits. The role of flower color varied with bee species and was influenced by the choice of the flower color model. Increasing bee visits increased seed set for all three bee species, with the steepest slope for leafcutting bees, followed by bumble bees, and finally honey bees. CONCLUSIONS: Floral display size influenced pollinator attraction more consistently than flower color. The same plant traits affected the probability of not being visited and the number of pollinator visits received. The impact of plant attractiveness on female reproductive success varied, together with pollinator effectiveness, by pollinator species.},

@article{Wyatt:1982aa,
	abstract = {{$[$}The adaptive significance of different types of inflorescences in flowering plants has been largely ignored. The few published studies investigating adaptive aspects of floral displays suggest that numbers of flowers and their arrangement in space and time determine levels of pollination and fruit-set in natural populations. The frequently conflicting demands placed on inflorescence architecture have led to an evolutionary compromise that maximizes the genetic contribution of an individual plant to the next generation. These conflicting demands include pollinator attraction vs. ovary competition, fruit dispersal vs. fruit predation, and reproductive vs. vegetative resource allocation. In most cases, the inflorescence size most successful in fruit production is also the most frequent in natural populations. In addition to quantity of offspring, inflorescence architecture affects, and in turn is affected by, the quality of offspring that result from selfing vs. outcrossing.{$]$}},

	abstract = {Flower size is a key trait in the reproductive ecology of animal-pollinated plants. However, pollinator-mediated selection does not always modulate this trait and environmental conditions and/or antagonist interactions may favor smaller flowers. We evaluate the occurrence of a large-flowered family in a hot and dry Mediterranean environment, mediated by a cost-benefit balance and a male--female conflict. Large flowers have sizeable benefits in terms of pollination and reproductive success and pollinators mediate selection through male function, but female fitness is context-dependent. High floral production and maintenance costs and florivore incidence in large flowers limit female function, which counteracts pollinator-mediated selection. Large flowers are highly costly in the Mediterranean and flower size is mediated by a sexual conflict between the benefits of male function and the costs of the female one. However, a short floral longevity, occasional pollen limitation and selection through maleness keep the existence of large flowers in these environments.},

We examined variation in the size and number of open flowers in wild daffodils (Narcissus). Our analysis of published data on 45 taxa showed that flower number varied negatively with flower diameter among Narcissus species, which supports the widespread assumption that there is a trade?off between these traits. In contrast, field measurements indicated a positive relation between flower number and diameter within two populations of Narcissus dubius, and no relation was evident after we controlled for variation in bulb size. The discrepancy between inter? and intraspecific patterns may have occurred because variable resource levels obscure trade?offs when variation in flower size is low (e.g., within species). Size?related increases in floral tube length were half as great as corresponding increases in flower diameter, a result that is consistent with stronger stabilizing selection on tube length. Staggered flowering within N. dubius inflorescences limited the mean number of open flowers to <66{\%} of total flower number, and slow expansion by later opening flowers resulted in significant differences in flower size throughout flowering. Although pollinators preferred large flowers, experimental reductions in flower diameter did not affect seed production. Our results illustrate how the relative importance of the factors influencing floral display can vary among levels of biological organization. Interspecific variation in flower size and number appeared to be constrained by allocation trade?offs, but intraspecific variation in both traits was more greatly influenced by plant resource status.

@article{Schmid-Hempel:1988aa,
	abstract = {{$[$}In the field, inflorescences of Epilobium angustifolium L. were experimentally manipulated to contain above average (LARGE) or below-average (SMALL) numbers of open flowers. We then estimated size-dependent fitness achieved per open flower from pollinator visitation rates, amount of pollen exported and pollen deposited. On average, rate of bee arrival (the principal pollinators) on LARGE (88 $\pm$7.9 S.E. arrivals/hour, N = 52) was 1.5 times that of SMALL (59 $\pm$5.5, N = 53), and bees visited 1.3 times as many flowers before they left (LARGE: 4.3 $\pm$0.2; SMALL: 3.2 $\pm$0.1). However, visitation rates to single flowers were similar for both size classes (LARGE: 23 $\pm$2.1 flowers/hour; SMALL: 24 $\pm$2.1); no difference with respect to sex of the flowers visited was found. In addition, both pollen export and pollen deposition were similar for the two size groups. We therefore conclude that for single flowers male function (pollen donation) and female function (pollen receipt) are both independent of inflorescence size. However, at the same time, flowers on LARGE inflorescences are visited by a larger number of individually different bees than flowers on SMALL, suggesting a higher diversity of mates for the flowers of LARGE. On LARGE inflorescences bees were also less likely to move directly from male to female flowers. With pollen carryover, however, this latter advantage may be counterbalanced by the generally longer visitation sequences on LARGE (4.3 $\pm$0.2 flowers/inflorescence/bee; SMALL: 3.2 $\pm$0.1), leading to a similar proportion of female flowers (incorrectly) visited after a visit to a male (LARGE: 67.6{\%}, N = 146; SMALL: 61.6{\%}, N = 144).{$]$}},

	n2 = {Summary 1 Pollinators visiting large floral displays may probe several flowers in sequence, leading to geitonogamous (among-flower) self-pollination. To investigate the relationship between floral display size and patterns of pollinator movement, we studied foraging by several pollinator species in four replicate arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae). In each array displays were trimmed to two, four, eight and 16 flowers per plant. 2 Bees preferred large displays, and probed more flowers in sequence on large than on small displays. However, the proportion of available flowers probed decreased with display, resulting in nearly equal floral visitation rates across treatments. 3 Because pollinators probed more flowers in sequence on large displays, plants with numerous flowers should experience more geitonogamous self-pollination than plants with small displays. 4 In all four treatments, pollinators frequently visited only one flower before leaving the plant. As the first flower probed on a plant cannot receive geitonogamous pollen, this potentially reduces selfing rates for those flowers, compared to flowers probed late in a long visitation sequence on a plant. Such differences among flowers in pollination history should increase variation in geitonogamous self-pollination among fruits within plants. 5 The three most abundant pollinator species differed significantly in behaviours that could influence plant mating patterns, including number of flowers probed per plant; interplant movement distances; and grooming. Variation in foraging patterns was also evident among individuals within species. These subtle differences in response should affect the pollination services provided to plants.},

	abstract = {{$[$}Diverse pollinator assemblages may impose complex selection and thus limit specialisation to particular pollinators. Previous work has concentrated on how visitation rates of different pollinators vary in space and time and how pollinators may vary in efficiency. In this study I quantify variation in visitation rates and foraging behaviour of different insect types (1) in space and time and (2) in relation to variation in floral design (flower size and form) and floral display (number of open flowers) for the distylous clonal shrub Jasminum fruticans. Mean visitation rate showed a significant interaction between insect type and population for seven populations in one year, and between insect types and years for a single population over 3 years. There was also a significant interaction between insect type and population for the proportion of flowers visited. In general the number of visits was positively related to the number of open flowers in a patch, but analyses by insect type showed that this was only true for bee flies and butterflies. Short-tongued bees showed a positive relationship between visitation rate and the number of open flowers on the focal stem, and hawkmoths and butterflies made more visits to plants with larger flowers. Hawkmoths were the only insect type to show a positive relation between the number of flowers visited per foraging bout and flower size. The significant differences between different insect types in patterns of variation in visitation rates in response to floral design and display may act to diversify selection on floral traits, and thereby constrain specialisation of the plant to particular pollinators.{$]$}},

Flower diversity inspires masterpieces of art and literature, fuels highway beautification schemes, gives amateur gardeners moments of great joy and pride, and nurtures industries of bulb growers, seed companies, and horticultural supply houses. Botanists, for their part, have pondered the processes driving diversification in flower form for over two centuries (Sprengel {$[$}1793{$]$} 1972). Nearly all botanists give animal pollinators credit for the vast smorgasbord of flower shapes and sizes observed in nature. This conclusion is intuitively satisfying in that pollinators have the motive (energy and nutrition gain) and the means (via pollen transfer, a key step in plant sexual reproduction) to exert selection on the floral features of their host plants. Moreover, the taxonomic diversity of pollinators (insects, rodents, lizards, fish, primates, and birds) accommodates a tremendous range of morphology, sensory modality, and behavior to match the variation in flower form.},

Total reproductive investment and partitioning of that investment was documented at the level of whole plants in terms of four ecologically relevant currencies: biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nutrient augmentations in the field confirmed that nutrients were limiting plant vegetative growth and propensity to flower; thus the use of these nutrients as currency was appropriate. Once the effects of plant size were removed, the sex morphs allocated similar total amounts of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to reproduction, but partitioned those differentially. For any given individual size, females allocated larger proportions of their reproductive resource budgets to seeds. Hermaphrodites' reproductive investment in pollen and flowers was allocated at the expense of allocation to seeds. These data are relevant to the evolution of gynodioecy from hermaphroditism and support the hypothesis that females reallocate resources not spent on pollen to seeds.},

	abstract = {Plant traits that increase pollinator visitation should be under strong selection. However, few studies have demonstrated a causal link between natural variation in attractive traits and natural variation in visitation to whole plants. Here we examine the effects of flower number and size on visitation to wild radish by two taxa of pollinators over 3 years, using a combination of multiple regression and experimental reductions in both traits. We found strong, consistent evidence that increases in both flower number and size cause increased visitation by syrphid flies. The results for small bees were harder to interpret, because the multiple regression and experimental manipulation results did not agree. It is likely that increased flower size causes a weak increase in small-bee visitation, but strong relationships between flower number and small-bee visitation seen in 2 years of observational studies were not corroborated by experimental manipulation of this trait. Small bees may actually have responded to an unmeasured trait correlated with flower number, or lower small-bee abundances when the flower number manipulation was conducted may have reduced our ability to detect a causal relationship. We conclude that studies using only 1 year, one method, or measuring only one trait may not provide an adequate understanding of the effects of plant traits on pollinator attraction.},

@article{Herrera:2009aa,
	abstract = {While pollinators may in general select for large, morphologically uniform floral phenotypes, drought stress has been proposed as a destabilizing force that may favour small flowers and/or promote floral variation within species.The general validity of this concept was checked by surveying a taxonomically diverse array of 38 insect-pollinated Mediterranean species. The interplay between fresh biomass investment, linear size and percentage corolla allocation was studied. Allometric relationships between traits were investigated by reduced major-axis regression, and qualitative correlates of floral variation explored using general linear-model MANOVA.Across species, flowers were perfectly isometrical with regard to corolla allocation (i.e. larger flowers were just scaled-up versions of smaller ones and vice versa). In contrast, linear size and biomass varied allometrically (i.e. there were shape variations, in addition to variations in size). Most floral variables correlated positively and significantly across species, except corolla allocation, which was largely determined by family membership and floral symmetry. On average, species with bilateral flowers allocated more to the corolla than those with radial flowers. Plant life-form was immaterial to all of the studied traits. Flower linear size variation was in general low among conspecifics (coefficients of variation around 10 {\%}), whereas biomass was in general less uniform (e.g. 200--400 mg in Cistus salvifolius). Significant among-population differences were detected for all major quantitative floral traits.Flower miniaturization can allow an improved use of reproductive resources under prevailingly stressful conditions. The hypothesis that flower size reflects a compromise between pollinator attraction, water requirements and allometric constraints among floral parts is discussed.},

	n2 = {In this paper we examine some ecological consequences and phenotypic correlates of flower size variation in wild radish, Raphanus sativus. Mean corolla diameter varied significantly among individuals within natural populations of R. sativus in California. On the average, almost 40{\%} of flower biomass was allocated to corolla tissue. In field experiments, pollinator visitation increased significantly with corolla size. Large flowers also accumulated more nectar when pollinators were excluded from plants. In three populations, corolla size was positively correlated with allocation to pollen per flower (either anther weight or pollen grain number), but there was usually no phenotypic relationship between corolla size and several measures of female allocation (ovule number per flower, proportion fruit set, and total seed mass per fruit). Plants growing in the field produced fewer large flowers per unit of stem, and stem biomass was negatively related to corolla size for plants grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Male and female fitness may covary differently with allocation to attractive floral features in species such as R. sativus, where seed production is often limited by resources rather than by pollen.},
