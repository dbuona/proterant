\noindent Woody perennials have a unique ability among plants to seasonally begin reproduction prior to vegetative growth. This flowering-first phenological sequence known as hysteranthy, proteranthy or precocious flowering is particularly common in temperate, deciduous forests around the globe \citep{Rathcke_1985}. A number of studies suggest that this flower-leaf sequences (FLSs) are under selection, and that hysteranthy has functional significance \citep{Gougherty2018,Buonaiuto2020,Guo2014}.

\noindent The most common, and well-tested explanation for the evolution of hysteranthy in temperate forests is that it is adaptive for wind-pollination, as leafless canopies increase wind speeds for pollen transport and reduce the likelihood of pollen interception by vegetation \citep{Whitehead1969,Niklas1985}. In the dry-deciduous tropics of South and Central America, hysteranthy is also common \citep{Rathcke_1985,Franklin2016}, and is regarded as an important adaptation to alleviate water stress by partitioning the hydraulic demand of flowers and leaves across the season \citep{Gougherty2018,Franklin2016,Borchert1983,Reich1984}.

However, these explanations do not address the widespread prevalence of hysteranthy in biotically-pollinated taxa found in temperate regions that are rarely water-limited in the early season during which flowering and leafing occur \citep{Polgar2011}. This number is not trivial; a recent analysis found that approximately 20\% of the hysteranthy species in the moist, Eastern Temperate Forests of North America are biotically pollinated \citep{Buonaiuto2020}. With mounting evidence anthropogenic climate change is driving shifts in flower-leaf sequences \citep{Ma2020:aa}, expanding our understanding of the functional significance of hysteranthy to included these groups is vital to forecasting the demography and performance of forest communities in an era of global climate change.

%Despite the fact that  hysteranthous flowering in biotically-pollinated taxa violate (better word), the conventional explanation for this phenological syndrome, 

\subsection*{Hypotheses of Hysteranthous flowering in biotically pollited taxa}
Several alternative hypotheses to the wind pollination hypothesis have been put forth and may help explain the function of hysteranthy in biotically-pollinated species.  
 
\underline{Water limitation hypothesis:} Despite being considered a ``wet" biome, there is still considerable variation in water availability in space and time within temperate regions of the globe. It is possible that the function of hysteranthous flowering in these regions parallels that in the dry tropics---partitioning hydraulic demand across the season to allow hysteranthous species to tolerate increased aridity. If this is the case, we would expect to find hysteranthous taxa in locations that are, on average, drier than their non-hysteranthous kin.

%\underline{Freeze tolerance hypothesis:} There is a demonstrated physiological relationship between drought and freeze tolerance, and it has been suggested that adaptations to drought allowed plants to expand their ranges higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere \citep{}. It is possible that hysteranthy contributed to this adaptation, though the mechanisms by which hysteranthous flowering may contribute to cold tolerance has not been investigated. One possibility is that for long lived organisms like woody plants, occasional frost damage to flowers has less of an impact on lifetime fitness, than damage to leaves (say better, I think I have old writing that might say this better). With this hypothesis, we would expect hysteranthous species to be found at colder sites than related non-hysteranthous ones. (Drop this if I don't have readily available data to test it.)

\underline{Insect-visibility hypothesis:} Hysteranthous flowers are visually conspicuous in the landscape. It is possible that like in wind pollinated taxa, hysteranthy in biotically pollinated taxa is an adaptation for pollination efficiency as a flowering-first species are easier for insects pollinators to locate \citep{Janzen1967}. This hypothesis predicts that flower displays will differ in size between flowering- first and leafing-first species. Though the direction is unclear. 1) Hysteranthy may be associated with smaller flowers. Since flower are not obscured by leaves, they are easier to see, there is weaker selection on large floral display. 2) Hysteranthy may be associated with bigger flowers. Because these species are going all in on visual displays, big flower might be additive to the benefits of hysteranthy. A second complicating factor is that there is likely to be associates between flower size and hysteranthy even if pollinator visibility doesn't matter due to developmental constraints. For example it requires more time and energy to produce big displays, so non-hysteranthous species that flower later in the season, after leaves emerge to gather energy are can produce bigger displays than early flowering hysteranthous species. (Could also move some of these nuances and contradictions for the discussion)

\underline{Phenological niche extension:} Species that flower before their leaves inherently flower early in the season. It is possible that hysteranthy flower is simply a by-product of selection for early flowering.
 Spring flower phenology is less constrained by prior phenological events than leaf phenology \citep{Savage2019}, which could allow selection to drive flowering into the early season, producing the hysteranthous phenological sequence. With this hypothesis there is no specific adaptive advantage to hysteranthy;  selection is not operating on the relative timing of flower and leaf emergence, but rather the absolute flowering time alone.

\underline{Fruit maturaturion hypothesis:} Like the phenological niche hypothesis describe above, there are several aspects of reproductive development that suggest hysteranthy is a by-product for early flowering, driven by development constraints. Hysteranthy may be common in large fruited species that require lots of time to mature their fruits. Alternatively, its may be common in small, early fruiting species that have evolved dispersal syndromes (wind dispersal, non-dormant seeds) that require dispersal early in the season. In either case, we  should expect fruit size to associate with hysteranthy.

Of course none of the hypotheses are mutually exclusive. One challenge is the same traits correlation could be driven by different mechanisms (i.e., small flower could be insect-visibility, developmental constraint, aridity tolerance or all of the above). Yet, a detailed investigation of the association between hysteranthy and the representative traits of each of these hypotheses would pinpoint those with the strongest theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence, as well as identify clear directions for future work to better understand the role that flower-leaf sequences play in woody plant fitness.


\noindent A second challenge for robust testing of hysteranthy hypotheses is that most characterizations of flower-leaf phenological sequences are based on expert-opinion verbal descriptions (e.g. ``flowers before leaves" or ``flower before/with leaves"), which make comparisons across taxa, time and space difficult and sensitive to observer bias  \citep[see;][]{Buonaiuto2020}. This problem can be overcome by adopting standardized quantitative measures of plant phenology for observational studies and applying them to historic data records. Herbarium records are an excellent source of data that can be leveraged for quantitative phenological measurements \citep{Willis2017}, but have not be used widely to investigate variability of flower-leaf sequences variation among and within species.



The American plums (\textit{Prunus} subspp. \textit{prunus} sect. \textit{prunocerasus}) offer potential for a high resolution investigation of drivers of hysteranthous flowering in taxa that don't fit the bill. (Better topic sentence needed.) The 16 species that make up the section are distributed across the temperate zone of North America and, like the genus \textit{Prunus} at large, are all insect-pollinated, yet show pronounced inter-specific variation in flower-leaf sequences.  Species in this section are well represented in herbaria records (Fig. \ref{fig:mappy}), making them a tractable group to measure and assess variation in flower-leaf sequences as well as other ecological and morphological characteristics that may explain the evolution of this variation. 


\noindent In this study we ask: do the observed associations between flower-leaf sequences variation and select morphological and environmental traits match predicted associations of the hysteranthy hypotheses? We used herbaria records to to quantify flower-leaf sequence patterns in the American plums, (subspecies  \textit{Prunus}, sect. \textit{prunocerasus}). We then evaluated the association between hysteranthy and several ecological and morphological traits to interrogate the functional hypotheses for hysteranthous flowering described above. We then compare our findings in this clade to associations between hysteranthy and traits in the larger genus obtained from published accounts in flora to better understand how these dynamics vary over taxonomic scales. Our findings both clarify the hypothesized function of flower-leaf sequence variation in biotically-pollinated taxa, and offer insights into how shifting flower-leaf sequences may impact species demography and distributions as climate continues to change.

%However, there are two major methodological challenges to testing the hydraulic demand hypothesis: First, characteristics like aridity tolerance, are the emergent product of a suite of biological traits \citep{Simova:2017vk}. Thus, when analyzing selective drivers of any particular trait at large taxonomic scales, unmeasured trait differences may obscure the estimated effects of the trait of interest, biasing results. This is a common problem in trait-based ecology, and one of the most promising solutions for understanding the functional significance of hysteranthy in woody plants is through character deconstruction \citep{Terribile2009}; comparing flower-leaf sequences variation for only a subset of taxa of shared phylogenetic and morphological character.   

%\noindent A second challenge for robust testing of hysteranthy hypotheses is that most characterizations of flower-leaf phenological sequences are based on expert-opinion verbal descriptions (e.g. ``flowers before leaves" or ``flower before/with leaves"), which make comparisons across taxa, time and space difficult and sensitive to observer bias  \citep[see;][]{Buonaiuto2020}. This problem can be overcome by adopting standardized quantitative measures of plant phenology for observational studies and applying them to historic data records. Herbarium records are an excellent source of data that can be leveraged for quantitative phenological measurements \citep{Willis2017}, but have not be used widely to investigate variability of flower-leaf sequences variation among and within species.

%Despite the pervasiveness of this phenological syndrome, direct tests of the function of hysteranthy in biotically pollinated taxa are rare for temperate forest species.
%but

%therefore


%. and in these ecosystems, flowering is associated with a recovery in plant water status due to leaf drop \citep{Borchert1983,Reich1984}. By temporally separating leaf and flower activity, woody plants can partition their hydraulic demand across the season, alleviating water stress \citep{Gougherty2018,Franklin2016}. 


%However, this hypothesis fails to address the prevalence of hysteranthous taxa that are biotically-pollinated. Approximately 30\% of woody plant species of Eastern temperate forests of North America flower before leafing out, and of these, approximately 20\% are biotically pollinated  \citep{Buonaiuto2020}. Despite the pervasiveness of this phenological syndrome, direct tests of the function of hysteranthy in biotically pollinated taxa are rare for temperate forest species.

%Yet looking to other biomes in which hysteranthous flowering is also common offers important insights regarding the function of hysteranthy in temperate, biotically-pollinated taxa. In the dry-deciduous tropics of South and Central America, flowering during the leafless period is also common \citep{Rathcke_1985,Franklin2016}. In these ecosystems, flowering is associated with a recovery in plant water status due to leaf drop \citep{Borchert1983,Reich1984}. By temporally separating leaf and flower activity, woody plants can partition their hydraulic demand across the season, alleviating water stress \citep{Gougherty2018,Franklin2016}. These physiological observations suggest that hysteranthous flowering may be an adaptation to arid environments.

%It is unclear whether this hydraulic demand hypothesis (also refered to as the water dynamic hypothesis \citep{Gougherty2018} or water limitation hypothesis \citep{Buonaiuto2020}) is relevant in the temperate zone where forests are rarely water-limited in the early season during which flowering and leafing occur \citep{Polgar2011}.%, and evidence of links between hysteranthy and aridity tolerance is mixed \citep{Gougherty2018,Buonaiuto2020} 
%Yet the hypothesis yields several predictions to evaluate whether hysteranthy serves to increase aridity tolerance in temperate flora:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Hysteranthous taxa should be found in dryer habitats compared to closely related, non-hysteranthous species.
%\item Hysteranthy may be linked to other reproductive traits associated with dry environments such as reduced flower and fruit size \citep{Herrera:2009aa,Liu:2013ua}.
%\item Additionally, flower-leaf sequences can be highly variable within individuals across time \citep{Buonaiuto2020}, and if hysteranthy contributes to aridity tolerance, climate variability may be positively correlated with variability in hysteranthy.
%\end{enumerate}
%\noindent With mounting evidence anthropogenic climate change is both driving shifts in flower-leaf sequences \citep{Ma2020:aa} and changing geographic patterns of water availability \citep{Overpeck11856}, understanding the functional significance of hysteranthy is vital to forecasting the demography and performance of forest communities in an era of global climate change. However, there are two major methodological challenges to testing the hydraulic demand hypothesis:

%\noindent First, characteristics like aridity tolerance, are the emergent product of a suite of biological traits \citep{Simova:2017vk}. Thus, when analyzing selective drivers of any particular trait at large taxonomic scales, unmeasured trait differences may obscure the estimated effects of the trait of interest, biasing results. This is a common problem in trait-based ecology, and one of the most promising solutions for understanding the functional significance of hysteranthy in woody plants is through character deconstruction \citep{Terribile2009}; comparing flower-leaf sequences variation for only a subset of taxa of shared phylogenetic and morphological character.

\section*{Methods}
%\subsection{Study system}
%\noindent The genus \texit{Prunus} comprises approximately 200 species distributed across the globe \citep{Chin:2014wu}, Within the genus, The American plums (\textit{Prunus} subspp. \textit{prunus} sect. \textit{prunocerasus}) offer potential for a higher resolution investigation of drivers of hysteranthous flowering. The 16 species that make up the section are distributed across North America and, like the genus \textit{Prunus} at large, show pronounced inter-specific variation in flower-leaf sequences. While within the larger genus species can be separated into three distinct morphological clades by inflorescence architecture (solitary, corymbose or racemose) all members of the section share solitary inflorescences \citep{Shaw:2004aa} allowing for refined character deconstruction. Species in this section are well represented in herbaria records (Fig. \ref{fig:mappy}), making them a tractable group to measure and assess variation in flower-leaf sequences as well as other ecological and morphological characteristics related to the hydraulic demand hypothesis. 

\subsection{Quantifying flower-leaf sequence variation}
We obtained digital herbarium specimens for all member of the section \textit{Prunocerasus} from the Consortium of Midwest Herbaria (CMH) Database. To quantify the flower-leaf sequence sequence variation within and across species we randomly sample 200 specimens for each species and scored the phenological development of flower and leaves using a modified BBCH scale for woody plants \citep{Finn2007}. In total, we evaluated the phenology of 2521 specimens, but only specimens with visible flowers were included in this analysis (n=1009). We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among species in this group based on the tree topology in \citet{Shaw:2004aa}. Following the methods of \citet{Granfen1989} we computed branch lengths for this phylogeny by assigning each node a height and computing the distance between upper and lower nodes using the R package ``ape" \citep{Paradis2019}.
%\textit{Need to write this part more professionally}. To compute a phylogentic signal for flower-leaf sequence variation, we calculated the mean of the log(vegetative BBCH observed during flowering) for each species and calculated Bloomberg's K using the function phylosig \citep{}. 

To quantify FLS variation, we fit an ordinal, hierarchical, Bayesian, phylogenetic mixed model \citep{Garamszegi2014} to assess the likelihood an individual would be at any given vegetative BBCH phase while flowering. Because we expect that hysteranthy is more likely to occur earlier in the flowering period and species differ in their flowering periods, we included the day of the observation as a varying slope, main effect in the model and species and phylogeny as random effects. The model is written below:\\

$logit(P(Y \leq j)) &= \beta_{[j]phylo[i]}+ \beta_{[j]sp[i]}+ \beta_{day of year[sp[i]]}*X_1+ \epsilon_{i}$\\
  
   \epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\ 
   
   where Y is the ordinal outcome (leaf stage) and j is the number of categories (1,2,...6). $P(Y \leq j))$ is the probability of Y less than of equal to a category j&=1,...j&-1.  In this varying slope and intercept model, $\beta_{[j]}$ describes an intercept for each category [1,2,...6], while slope \$beta_{day of year[sp[i]]}$ is constant across categories. 
  
  \noindent The influence of the phylogeny $\alpha_{phylo}$ was modeled as follows:\\
  \alpha_{sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, COR[\sigma^2_{phylo}]) \\
  
  \noindent The $\alpha$ for species effects independent of the phylogeny was modeled as follows:\\
  \alpha_{sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma^2_{species}) \\

 We fit the model in the R package ``brms" \citep{Burkner2018} using weakly informative priors, and ran the model on four chains with a warm up of 3,000 iterations and 4,000 sampling iterations for a total of 4,000 sampling iterations. Model fit was assessed with Rhats <1.01 and high effective sample sizes and no divergent transitions.
 
Because the day of observation strongly influenced the BBCH stage likelihood, quantifying flower-leaf sequences among species was intractable without accounting for this temporal trend. To address this issues, we used our model to predict the likelihood each species would be observed at a given vegetative BBCH stage during flowering at the 0\%, 25\% 50\% and 75\% quantiles of their flowering period. We then developed a flower-leaf sequence index, by assigning a numerical score to each species per seasonal quantile, and summing over the full flowering season. In each seasonal quantile, species received a 1 if more that 50\% of their probability distribution occurred at BBCH 0 and BBCH 09 and a 0 if not. These values were summed across the season generating an index from 0 (never hysteranthous) to 4 (hysteranthous through late season (Q75)), where 1&= hysteranthous at start of season, 2&= hysteranthous through early season  (Q25) and 3 &= hysteranthous  through mid season (Q50). We also used two alternative indexing schemes ($>$25\% of the probability distribution occurred at BBCH 0 and $>$40\% of the probability distribution occurred at BBCH 0 and BBCH 09).

\subsection{Evaluating hysteranthy hypotheses}

To test the predictions of the hypotheses of hysteranthy we obtained data on petal length, fruit diameter and directly from herbarium specimens. To assess aridity tolerance, we computed the average Palmer Modified Drought Index score from 1900-2017 for every \textit{Prunocerasus} specimen in the database (n=2305) from the North America Drought Atlas \citep{Cook2004}. For any specimens that lacked accurate geo-location information, we extracted PDSI values at the county centroid. 

\noindent For our morphological measurements, we sampled an additional 321 specimens measured the petal length of up to 10 randomly selected petals per specimen (n=2757) using ImageJ image processing software. We also used ImageJ to measure the diameter of fruits on an additional 316 specimens, measuring up to 5 fruit per specimen (n=224).

We than used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to test the relationship between flower-leaf sequence index scores and each of the variables. In these models, we included species and phylogeny as the random effect. 

The model structure is written below: 

  y_i &= \alpha_{ind/sp[i]} +\alpha_{phylo[i]} + \beta_{hyst.index}*X_{hyst.index} + \epsilon_i\\
  
  \epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\ %Check this
  
  \noindent The effect of the phylogeny was model as above.% and here, the individual effects within species were modeled:\\
  %alpha_{ind/sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma^2_{ind/sp}) \\
  
Like above, we fit these models in the R package ``brms" \citep{Burkner2018} using weakly informative priors, and ran the model on four chains with a warm up of 3,500 iterations and 4,500 sampling iterations for a total of 4,000 sampling iterations. Model fit was assessed with Rhats <1.01 and high effective sample sizes and no divergent transitions. We also ran each model using our two alternative FLS indexing approaches to make sure our particular indexing approach was not influencing our results. Though these alternative classification scheme did change the hysteranthy index score for some species (Fig. \ref{fig:plums}), they changes did not substantially impact the inference from our models (see Tab. \ref{tab:modput} for comparisons).

\subsection*{Hysteranthy in the larger genus \textit{Prunus}}

To better understand how the patterns we identified in our in depth study of the sect. \textit{Pruncerasus} scale across coarser taxonomic resolution we also evaluated the relationship between hysteranthous flowering and hypothesis-related traits in the all the \text{Prunus} species that are native or naturalized in North America. For this analyses, we obtained categorical descriptions of flower-leaf sequences and mean estimates of fruit diameter and number of flowers/inflorescence as a proxy for floral investment from the Flora of North America \citep{} for 32 species in the genus. As above, we evaluated the average aridity tolerance of each species by extracting average PDSI values from all herbaria records of those species in the CMH database (n=x). 
 
To account for the influence of evolutionary relationships among species, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships in the genus based on the tree topology in \citet{Chin:2014wu}. As as above, we computed branch lengths with the R package ``ape" \citep{Paradis2019}. 

We standardized the units of all predictors to make the directly comparable in the following model structure:

$logit(P(Y \leq j)) &= \beta_{[j]phylo[i]}+ \beta_{pdsi[sp[i]]}*X_1+\beta_{fruit diamter}*X_2+
+\beta_{floral investment}*X_3+\epsilon_{i}$\\
  
   \epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\ 
   
   where Y is the ordinal outcome of flower-leaf sequence category (``flowers before leaves",``flowers before/with leaves", ``flowers with leaves" and ``flowers after leaves") and j is the number of categories (1,2,...4). $P(Y \leq j))$ is the probability of Y less than of equal to a category j&=1,...j&-1.%  In this varying slope and intercept model, $\beta_{[j]}$ describes an intercept for each category [1,2,...4].
   
  \noindent As above, the influence of the phylogeny $\alpha_{phylo}$ was modeled as follows:\\
  \alpha_{sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, COR[\sigma^2_{phylo}]) \\

We fit these models in the R package ``brms" \citep{Burkner2018} using weakly informative priors, and ran the model on four chains with a warm up of 6,000 iterations and 8,000 sampling iterations for a total of 8,000 sampling iterations to maximize the effective sampling size. Model fit was assessed with Rhats <1.01 and high effective sample sizes and no divergent transitions.
%\noindent Because our data dependent and independent were collect we employed a sequential modeling approach to first estimate the mean and standard error of the posterior distribution of trait values for each species then model the relationship between these estimate and the likelihood of hysteranthy using Bayesian measurement error models. This approach propagates the error in the initial estimates of trait values into the our final model, yielding a more accurate evaluation than using mean trait values alone \citep{}. For each parameter of interest, we ran Bayesian phylogenetic mixed-effects models with our measured traits as the response variable and species as the random effect. For traits like flower petal length and fruit diameters than included multiple measurements per specimen, we included specimen ID as an additional random effect. The model structure is written below:

%\noindent Then using each of these trait mean estimates as predictors, we modeled their associations with flower leaf sequences OF using a repeat measure phylogenetic mixed ordinal regression in brms \citep{}. Because we found the three predictors of interested to be highly colinear (pariwise correlations >0.5), we ran one regression model per predictor trait to avoid skewing our model inference due to multi-collinearity \citep{MacElreath, Nations}.

%For all models in the sequences,

\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Quantifying flower leaf sequences in the American plums}
We found substantial inter-specific differences in flower-leaf sequences within the American plums (Fig. \ref{fig:ordinals}, \ref{fig:plums}). %The phylogenetic signal was relatively weak (Phylogenetic signal K : 0.28), and F
Flower-leaf sequence patterns were strongly dependent on the day of observations, with observations later in the the flowering season of each species decreasing the likelihood of finding flowers open during early vegetative BBCH phases ($\beta_{doy}$ 0.03, $CI_{50}$ [0.02,0.03] ). Based on our flower leaf sequence index, two species (\textit{P. umbellata},\text{P. mexicana}) were likely to be hysteranthous regardless of the time of observation and three species (\textit{P. rivularis},\texit{P. subcordata}, and \textit{P. texana}) were always most likely to flower after level expansion began (Fig. \ref{fig:phylo2}). All other species displayed intermediate phenotypes with five species mostly likely to hysteranthous at the start of the season (\textit{P. alleghaniensis},\texit{P. americana},\textit{P. hortulana},\textit{P. munsoniana} and \texit{P. nigra}), one species through early season (\textit{P gracilis}) and two species through mid season (\textit{P. angustifolia}, \textit{P. maritima}) (Fig \ref{fig:phylo2}).

\subsection*{Associations between hysteranthy and environmental and morphological traits}
In the American plums clad we found a negative association between flower-leaf sequence index and mean PDSI ($\beta$: -0.03 ,$CI_{50}$[-0.05,  0.02] ,Fig. \ref{fig:prunes}a.), suggesting that species that displayed hysteranthous flowering later into their flowering season are found in dryer locations. 

We found a negative association between flower-leaf sequence index and both petal length and fruit diameter (-.21, $CI_{50}$[-0.38 -0.04],-1.40, $CI_{50}$[-1.97 -0.82] respectively), though the relationship between FLS index and fruit size was much stronger (Fig. \ref{fig:prunes}b.,c.). This suggests that smaller fruits and flowers are associated with species that displayed hysteranthous flowering later into their flowering season.

At the genus level, there was a positive association between increasing pdsi and inflorescence size and increasing overlap between flowers and leaves  ($\beta$: 2.50, $CI_{50}$[1.17, 3.371] and $\beta$ 6.41,$CI_{50}$[3.86, 8.05] respectively, Fig. \ref{fig:genus}a), suggesting that hysteranthy is associated with drier locations and smaller floral displays (Fig. \ref{fig:genus}b). The estimated effect of fruit size in the model was negative ($\beta$: -1.24, $CI_{50}$[-1.95,-0.21), \ref{fig:genus}a)]. Small fruits were mostly likely to be associated with species that flower with their leaves, and large fruits with species that flower before leaves, though there was high uncertainty around these estimates in our model (Fig. \ref{fig:genus}b). 

\section*{Discussion}
Our analyses of hysteranthous flowering in North American \emph{Prunus} species offer several critical insights into the evolution and function of this phenological syndrome in this genus, that can be extended to make inference on the role of hysteranthy in biotically-pollinated species at large.

Our high-resolution analysis of the American plums clade revealed that even within species flower-leaf sequences are highly labile. For all members of the clade, the day of phenological observation was a strong predictor of the likelihood that flowers would be visible before the emergence of leaves. %and at any observation time over the course of the flowering season,  
In many cases, there was high likelihood that individuals of a species may be observed at different vegetative stages during flowering (Fig. \ref{fig:prunes}, \ref{fig:plums}). The intra-specific variability we detected in our study furthers a growing call to adopt a bottom-up, observational approach to the study of flower-leaf sequences by quantifying flower-leaf sequences  at the individual level and modeling these patterns are coarser taxonomic scales rather that treating them as immutable categorical patterns at the species level \citep{Buonaiuto2020}.  

Despite this, the coherence of inference between our bottom-up, observational approach for the American plum clade and the top-down, categorical approach we took for the larger genus \emph{Prunus} is an encouraging demonstration that the categorical species level based on expert opinion approach can still offer useful insights the the drivers of hysteranthous flowering when higher-resolution data is not available. Our modeled flower-leaf sequences patterns of the American plums qualitatively with previous characterizations of the the species-level variation in this group \citep{Shaw:2004aa}. Across taxonomic scales and data approaches, our analyses agree that within the North American species of the genus \emph{Prunus}, hysteranthous taxa occurred in more arid environments, and tended to have smaller floral displays. In the American plums clade, smaller fruits were associated with less overlap between flowering and leaf development while at the genus level, smaller fruits were weakly associated with more flower-leaf overlap.  Comparing the direction and strength of these association across taxonomic scales helps to hone the hypotheses of hysteranthy and identifies important realms of further inquiry.

\subsection*{Relationships to the hypotheses}
\subsubsection*{Hydraulic demand}
The direction associations between pdsi and flower-leaf sequences follow the expectations the water limitation hypothesis, with hysteranthous species occupying generally drier area. 
%These results indicate that even though water limitation less common during the flowering season in temperate trees, the temporal segregation of flowering and leaf phenology can impact whole plant-water status later in the season.

Studies that have compared the transpiration rates among flowers and leaves that occur simultaneously provide insights to the potential importance of this seasonal partitioning for maintaining water status. These studies report floral transpiration rates of flowers can range from 20\%-60\% of that of leaves under comparable conditions \citep{Whiley:1988uf,Roddy:2012wn}. This additional hydraulic demand can drive loss of stomatal conductance and  decrease photosynthetic rates \citep{Galen:1999vr}. A recent study \citet{Liu:2017wg} comparing hydraulic properties of flowers and leaves in two hysteranthous tree species (\textit{Magnolia spp}), found that sap flow to flowers (a measure of water movement) was 22-55\% that of leaves. When considering species in or study specifically, the xylem conductivity of spring floral branches of \textit{Prunus americana} is reported to be ~20\% of summer foliage branches \citep{McMann:2022ww}. Taken together, magnitude of water loss through floral organs in these physiological measurements demonstrate an underlying mechanism for the macro-ecological patterns we observed in our data.

However, when considering the likelihood that aridity is an evolutionary driver of hysteranthous flowering in biotically-pollinated species, its is important to consider the strength of the relationship as well as the direction. In the American plums, the mean PDSI at which all species were found ranged between -0.40 and 0.67, and at the larger genus PDSI values ranged from -.39 to .28 . The slope we estimated for the relationship between PDSI and shifts between FLS categories was weak with high residual variance, indicating that while  hysteranthous species may, on average, occupy marginally drier environments, this phenological trait alone may not facilitate species' persistence under extreme aridity. 

To better understand this, we must consider the flower-leaf sequences in the context of the full season phenological cycle of the clades we studied in comparison to the taxa that display this habit in the dry deciduous forest of neotropics (do we still say this word or is it colonialist?).

In all temperate \textit{Prunus} species, there is significant overlap between vegetative and reproductive phenological phases, even in hysteranthous species. While flowering may precede leafout by as much several weeks, the process of fruit development, which is also water intensive, occurs when leaves are present for all species. This suggests that over the course of a full seasonal cycle, the contribution of hysteranthous flowering to partitioning hydraulic demand mat be rather marginal. 

By contrast, hysteranthy in the dry tropics follows a different pattern. In these regions, flowering is initiated at the time of leaf drop \citep{Borchert1983,Franklin2016}, meaning that the full reproductive cycle occurs in the leafless period, which is would be a far more effective phenological sequence for coping with extreme aridity. If the hysteranthy taxa of the temperate zone evolved in environments more similar to the contemporary dry tropics, it is possible that the incidences of hysteranthy we see in the temperate zone are a vestige of ancestral selection.

Overall, our analysis suggest that it is difficult to parse out the complex relationship between phenological sequences and aridity tolerance from observational studies that use correlative approaches, and this field of inquiry would benefit strongly from more mechanistic experiments. Our analysis identifies closely related species with contrasting flower-leaf sequences patterns, that could serve as an important model system for such experiments. A more robust understanding of the contribution of hysterhanthy to drought tolerance could be achieved by planting sister-taxa with contrasting flower-leaf sequences in common environments across a gradient of aridity to address the the question at the heart of the water-limitation hypothesis: Do species with contrasting FLS respond differently in drought? Given that we observed high levels of within species variation in flower-leaf sequences in our observation, these experiments could also sever to evaluate whether temporal variability in flower-leaf sequences is associated with temporal variability in water availability or other environmental drivers.

\subsubsection*{Pollinator visibility}
In the clade Prunocerasus, we found hysteranthy was associated with smaller flowers, and in the larger genus, smaller inflorescences, which matches the expectation of one formulation of the the pollinator visibility hypothesis in which visibility is a trade off between phenology (hysteranthy) and structural investment (size). However as we eluded to in our introduction, an alternative prediction of the pollinator visibility is that hysteranthy should be part of a suite of traits that support visual foragers and should co-vary with increase flower size and trade off with secondary cues (chemical attractants, nectar rewards).

Our results reflect the first formulation, but just as in the case with the water limitation hypothesis, the association between FLS and flower size was relatively weak in the American plums. The stronger trend in the the relationship between inflorescence size and hysteranthy in the larger genus could also reflect the developmental constraint hypothesis, and it is not possible to distinguish between these two processes through trait correlations. As in the case of the hydraulic demand hypothesis, our understanding of the the insect-visibility hypothesis would benefit from experimental test of mechanism.

A first important step to sharpen the predictors of this hypothesis would be to consider hysteranthy, and phenology in general, in the more general framework of tradeoffs in pollination biology. The trade off between phenology and pollination investment should not only consider flower size, but also the number of flowers, nectar and pollen reward investment, volitiles between related hysteranthous and non-hysteranthous taxa. 

A second approach would be to observed the impact of hysteranthy on pollinator choice in experiments. While several studies support the idea that vegetative background can substantially alter the ability for pollinators to locate flowers \citep{Forrest:2009aa,Rivest:2017aa,Spaethe3898}, as far as we know, these no studies have explicitly tested pollinator choice in the context of phenological sequences.. A simple experiment to better assess the extent to which hysteranthy contributes to pollinator attraction would be to place hysteranthous and non-hysteranthy individuals in a controlled environment, and systemically release pollinators to observed their preference, search times and foraging behavior.

\subsection{Fruit maturaturion}
We observed contrasting trends for the relationship between  hysteranthy and fruit size, at the section and genus level. The association between larger fruits and hysteranthy  at the genus level development time hypotheses while association between hysteranthy and small fruits in the American plums support the predictions of the resource constraint hypothesis. We highlight that this trait was the poorest sampled in both of our data sources, with small numbers of observation in the herbaria data and high uncertainty in the genus-level models, so these patterns may reflect sampling bias rather than a biological pattern.


\subsection{Hypotheses are not mutally exclusive}
(I am not sure this section is so well thought out or even necessary). One limitation of the trait based approach is that many ecological and evolutionary processes can produce the same patterns. For example, the association between hysteranthy and flower size we observed may be a prediction of of the insect visibility hypothesis, but it would also support the water limitation hypothesis because reduced flower size itself is a signature of selection for aridity \citep{Teixido:2016aa,Lambrecht:2013aa}. It is possible that only one, or both of these selective forces have shaped flower-leaf sequences, resulting in a complex interplay of selection on phenological sequences.

Secondly, even if flower-leaf sequences are functionally adaptive in biotically-pollinated taxa, flowering phenology itself is also under selection and these forces may interaction in complicated ways. For example, selection on flower-leaf sequences may be strong for always hysteranthous and never hysteranthous species, but the flower-leaf sequences of species with moderate seasonal overlap may be the byproduct of drift, or selection on phenological niche differentiation, resembling OE evolution (this is something Jonathan said, but I am not sure how to explain it properly). 

\subsection{The big picture}
In this study we intentionally chose to analyze a small, and morphologically restricted taxonomic clade in order to reduce the impact of unmeasured biological variation on our traits of interest. This offers clear insights as a case-study, but limits our ability to infer the function of hysteranthy more broadly in biotically pollinated plant taxa. It would be useful to look at other temperate  groups with high interspecific flower-leaf sequences variation including Magnolia, Rhododendron, Acer and Cornus. In addition to assessing whether the trait associations are reproduced in other taxonomic groups, including more species in mechanistic experiments would give us more power to evaluate the importance of hysteranthy in form and function.

Our analyses support the general assertion that flower-leaf sequences are under selection by biological and environmental drivers, and that variation in these phenological patterns across species reflect adaptive tradeoffs. While our study cannot say unequivocally which hypotheses are most credible, understanding the general patterns of association between the relevant traits and flower-leaf sequences in the genus \textit{Prunus} outlines a more clear path forward to improve our understanding of phenological sequences through mechanistic experiments.


%Our finding that smaller flowers and floral displays were associated with hysteranthy at both the section and genius can be interpreted in the context of several of the hypotheses we presented above.


%in the Amerian plums may be surprising when viewed in the context of a classic ecological trade off. It is well established that larger flowers demand more resources to maintain turgor and reproductive function than smaller ones\citep{Galen:1999vr,Lambrecht:2007ur}, therefore one might expect that hysteranthous flowering serves to compensate for maintaining larger flowers and in dry environments. The fact that we observed a negative association between the degree of hysternathy and flower size suggests rather, that hysteranthy might be part of a suite of traits that operate to increase the aridity tolerance of a species.

%The negative relationship between hysteranthy and flower size we observed is also expected when considered in the context of resource allocation. A negative trade-off for the benefits gained by hysteranthous flowering is that hysteranthous woody plants much begin their reproductive investment from stored carbon alone; at the time of their annual cycle when their stored reserved are likely at their lowest \citep{}. The association between smaller flower and hysteranthous flowering has been observed in other clades \citep{}, though to our knowledge has not been investigated on the context of hydraulic costs or aridity tolerance. It it, however, clear that hysteranthous species have evolved specialized mechanisms for mobilizing water and carbohydrates early in the season to accommodate this resource partitioning strategy \citep{}. Sum up this paragraph.

%Of course, selection on both phenology and floral traits is driven by a number of other factors than just plant hydraulics and resource allocation. The support we found for the hydraic demand hypothesis does not rule out other eco-evo drivers shaping the flower-leaf sequences of insect-pollinated. In fact, the relationship we observed between hysteranthy with flowering and fruit size could also be evidence for alternative hypotheses for FLS.

%Pollinator attraction is major selective force on both floral phenology and morphology \citep{} and it has been alternatively suggested that hysteranthous flowering is an adaptation to increase the visibility of flowers to visually-foraging pollinators \citep{}. To our knowledge this hypothesis has not bee widely tested though there is evidence that background contrast does impact pollinators ability to locate flowers \citep{}. This hypothesis and the hydraulic demand hypothesis that we tested may be related, with loss of pollinator visibility that is associated with accompany the reduction in flower size \citep{} due to aridity compensated for by hysteranthous flowering. While we cannot make this mechanistic link from our analysis, our findings that hysteranthy is associated with aridity and reduced flower size set up intriguing follow up work to elucidate the ecological and evolutionary links between floral morphology and function, aridity and hysteranthous flowering.

%In this study we intentionally chose to analyze a small, and morphologically restricted taxonomic clade in order to reduce the impact of unmeasured biological variation on our traits of interest. Our findings compliment and clarify previous analyses performed at large taxonomic scales which suggested that aridity may be a more important driver in biotically pollinated taxa than wind pollinated ones \citep{}. It was interesting we found a relatively weak influence of phylogeny at our restricted scale, while it appears to be quite strong at larger ones 
%\citep{}. \textit{Jonathan is there something interesting we can say about this in a line or two?}

%To compliment the work that has been done at both very fine and course taxonomic resolution, it would be useful to explore the drivers of hysteranthy at an intermediate scale to better understand if the associations we observed in the American plums emerged at the genus or family level, or in other clades with strong intra-generic flower-leaf sequence variation like Rhododendron, Magnolia, Acer, Cornus. 

%Flower-leaf sequences patterns can vary substantially on an interannual basis with populations and even individuals \citep{}. It has been suggested that this variation is a product of differential sensitivity to temperature and light cues between flowers and leaves \citep{}, but if water limitation drives the evolution of hysteranthous flowering at the species level, it is possible that water availability may influence the plasticity of flower-leaf sequence on a seasonal timescale. Executing experimental or observational studies about this (say better) is an important step of for understanding the significance to the water dynamics hypothesis and for predict how woody plant phenological sequences may shift with climate change as local patterns of both temperature and water availability continue to change in the coming decades.
