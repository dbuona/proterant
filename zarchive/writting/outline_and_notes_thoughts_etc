Testing coventional wisdom approach.
I. Introduction
  hyp: pollination syndrome
  alt: adaption fofor early flowering
II. Methods
  A. Data collection
  B. Model building-full models michigan tree
  C. Early only, to see polinations
  D. Silvics- validate results. ***or find other data source

III.  Results
  A. Pollination syndrome, fruit time, flower time, and sort of height (short) significant
  B. Pollination robust to subset in early fruiters only
  C. Silvics--only flower time significant.
  
IV. 
  A. 
  C. Why? Less trust worthy data. Observation bias. Differences in hysterany classification. National rather ran regional dataset might make estimations of phenology un-unseful
  
Approach 2: Complicating the early flowering hypothesis.
I. Intro
  Hypothesis: hysteranthy is an adaptation for early flowering
  Alt: pollination syndrome or other traits are important too.
  
Methods:
  A. Simple model pro~flower_time for large rough data set silvics, Mich, or NPN, GBNPN
  B. Michigan trees, see it as a trust worthy dataset.
  
Results: same as above
Discussion: early flowering is king, but other things too. Why ecologically might early dispersal, shortness?

ISSSUES REMAINING:
iterate tree to account for random additions
understand scaling factors for bayesian vs. pgls
