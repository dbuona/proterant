Wind-pollination: Leafless flowering reduces barriers to pollen movement, allowing for more efficient pollen transfer.
Prediction: Strong association between FLS and pollination syndrome.

Water dynamics: Leafless flowering reduces hydraulic demand by temporally separating floral hydration and leaf transpiration.
Prediction: Strong association between FLS and hydraulic demand/drought tolerance. 

Early flowering: Leafless flowering is a byproduct of selection for early flowering and has no inherent function.
Prediction: Strong association between FLS and flowering time.

Phylogenetic conservatism: Leafless flowering is phylogenetically conserved and FLS variation reflects macro-evolutionary relationships among taxa.
Prediction: Strong phylogenetic signal is FLS variation.
