  \subsubsection*{Climate Change and FLS:}
  \noindent To evaluate how FLS patterns have changed over time in association with climate change we obtained phenological data for four European woody plant species with long term phenology records of both flower (BBCH 60) and leafout phenology (BBCH 11) from the Pan European Phenological Database \citep{PEP725}. We restricted the data set to include only stations with more than 50 years of data. Following conventions for modeling effects of climate change, we modeled the number of days between flowering and leafing as a function of time for each species, using a hinge model with 1980 as a break point \citep{IPCC2013,Kharouba2018}. For each species, we display the pre-1980 mean and 95\% credible intervals of the time between flowering and leafing and the post-1980 change in mean time between phenophases that can be attributed to climate change and box plots to summarize the uncertainty in the estimates (Fig. \ref{fig:climchange}).
  
  \subsubsection*{Modeling FLS variation in MTSV and USFS data}
  \noindent For these two categorical, species-level case-studies, we converted verbal descriptions of flower-leaf sequences into a binary response variable. For our more inclusive ``functional" definition of hysteranthy, which allows for some overlap between floral and vegetative phenophases, we included species entries with descriptions \textit{``flowers before the leaves"}, \textit{``flowers before or with leaves"} and \textit{``flowers with leaves"} as hysteranthous. Our more restrictive ``physiological" hysteranthy definition only included species described as \textit{``flowers before the leaves"} as hysteranthous.\\
  
  \noindent For modeling trait associations with FLSs, we chose three predictors to represent the three adaptive FLS hypotheses; pollination syndrome, average flowering time and minimum precipitation across a species' range. We obtained pollination syndrome and average flowering time information directly from the respective data sources and estimates of minimum precipitation across range from the USDA/NRCS Conservation Plants Characteristics (CPC) database \citep{usdancrs}. We coded pollination syndrome as biotic- or wind-pollinated, and assigned known ambophilous species in the genus \textit{Salix} as biotic-pollinated. We re-coded flowering time as the average of the range of months of flowering reported in each data source.\\
  
  \noindent For these case studies, we modeled associations between hysteranthy and the trait predictors with all two-way interactions with logistical regressions in a phylogenetic generalized linear modeling framework \citep{Ives2010} using the R package ``phylolm" \citep{Ho2014}. Model results are presented in Fig. \ref{fig:muplots.USMT}. Our models incorporated a published angiosperm phylogenetic tree \citep{Zanne2013} pruned to match the species list for each case study. Species found in the trait data set but not in the original phylogenetic tree were added to the pruned tree at the generic root. In total, 32 species were added to the generic roots for the MTSV data set and eight for the USFS data set. We visualized phylogenetic patterning of FLS across the tree of each case study (Fig. \ref{fig:phylogeny}). The MTSV analysis was based on trait and FLS data for 147 species and the USFS analysis on 81 species. \\
  
  \noindent We ran the models with 599 bootstrapped re-sampling iterations for each data set \citep{Wilcox2010}. We standardized all predictors by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations to allow for a reasonable comparison of effect sizes between the binary and continuous predictors in this model \citep{Gelman2007}. 
  
  
  \subsubsection*{Harvard Forest models}
  \noindnent From the publicly available Harvard Forest phenology data \citep{OKeefe2015} we calculated the days between flower budburst and leaf budburst for each individual tree per year in the data. We also calculated FLS timing using alternative phenophases; the days between flowers opening and leaves reaching 75\% of their final size. Positive FLS values indicate flowering-first and negative values leafing-first. We transformed these data to compare the inference between categorical, continuous, and intra-specific variation approaches to FLSs. To make the data categorical, we re-coded the continuous FLS measures as binary responses with positive values coded as hysteranthous and negative values as seranthous. For the continuous data, we calculated the mean FLS timing and day of flowering for each species. For the intra-specific variation model, individual variation in FLSs and flowering time was incorporated into the model as a random effect nested within species. These models used the same predictors as the MTSV and USFS datasets (flowering time, pollination syndrome, minimum precipitation across species' range and all two way interactions between predictors). To test the sensitivity of the models to specific functional traits used to represent the FLS hypotheses, we ran additional models based on three alternative functional traits: moisture use (defined as ``the ability to use (i.e., remove) available\linelabel{def} soil moisture relative to other species in the same (or similar) soil moisture availability region" \citep{usdancrs}, minimum temperature across a species range and the actual evapotranspiration/potential evapotranspiration ratio (AET/PET) across a species range for the water limitation hypothesis. We obtained the former two trait values from the CPC database and the latter from \citet{Thomspson2012}. Also from the CPC database, we obtained data on seed mass (numbers seed/pound) and mean dispersal time (based on estimates from MTSV) as alternative predictors the early flowering hypotheses (see Fig. \ref{fig:altpreds}). Some species that were represented in our main model had missing data for the AET/PET ratio. For these species, we imputed values based on single draws from a normal distribution around the overall mean and standard deviation of the predictor to allow for our models to run properly. We imputed AET/PET for 6 species.\\ 
  
  \noindent The Harvard Forest analysis included 23 species. While taxonomically limited compared to the MTSV and USFS data, this data set included repeated phenology observations per species over time, and within year variation between individuals per species. \\ 
  
  \noindent For both the categorical and quantitative Harvard Forest models we used a phylogenetic generalized linear modeling framework \citep{Ives2010} using the R package ``phylolm" \citep{Ho2014} built on a Bernoulli probability distribution for the categorical model and a Gaussian distribution for the quantitative model. For the intra-specific variation model, we used a Bayesian phylogenetic mixed modeling framework (PMM) \citep{Garamszegi2014} using the R package ``brms" \citep{Burkner2018}. PMM's incorporate the phylogenetic relationship among species as a random effect, utilizing a variance-covariance matrix based on species relationships to account for the non-independence in the model residuals that can be explained by phylogeny. We also included species as an additional random effect to account for non-independence in the residuals than is not due to phylogeny, and included individual as a nested factor within this random intercept to account for the repeat observations over time and differences among individuals. With this model, we ran 4 chains with 4000 iterations and a warm-up of 3000 iterations each, resulting in 4000 total sampling iterations. Models used weakly informative priors on the intercept and error terms. Increasing priors three-fold did not impact the model estimates. As our primary goal was to directly compare the effects of each predictor, we standardized these variables to allow for a reasonable comparison between them {\citep{Gelman2007}. Model results can be found in Fig. \ref{fig:muplotsHF}, Fig. \ref{fig:altpreds}. and Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity}.\\
  
  %\noindent The three Harvard Forest models are detailed below:\\
  %\begin{enumerate}
  %\item \underline{Categorical model}:\\
  %Pr(y_i &=1) &= logit^{-1} \alpha_{sp[i]} + \alpha_{phylo[i]} + \beta_{pollination syndrome}X_1_[_i_] + \beta_{flowering time}X_2_[_i_] + \beta_{min. precipitation}X_3_[_i_] +\beta_{pollination syndrome}:\beta_{flowering time}X_4_[_i_]+\beta_{pollination syndrome}:\beta_{min. precipitation}X_5_[_i_]+ \beta_{flowering time}:\beta_{min. precipitation}X_6_[_i_] + \epsilon_i\\
  %
  %\epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\ 
  %
  %\noindent The influence of the phylogeny $\alpha_phylo$ was modeled as follows:\\
  %\alpha_{sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, COR[\sigma^2_{phylo}]) \\
  %
  %\noindent THe $\alpha$ for species effects indendent of the phylogeny was modeled as follows:\\
  %\alpha_{sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma^2_{species}) \\
  %
  %\item \underline{Continuous model}: \\
  %y_i &= \alpha_{ind/sp[i]} +\alpha_{phylo[i]} + \beta_{pollination syndrome}X_1_[_i_] + \beta_{flowering time}X_2_[_i_] + \beta_{min. precipitation}X_3_[_i_] +\beta_{pollination syndrome}:\beta_{flowering time}X_4_[_i_]+\beta_{pollination syndrome}:\beta_{min. precipitation}X_5_[_i_]+ \beta_{flowering time}:\beta_{min. precipitation}X_6_[_i_] + \epsilon_i\\
  
  %\epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\ %I Think this is wrong and should reflect the phyogeny
  %
  %
  %\noindent The effect of the phylogeny was model as above and here, the individual effects within species were modeled:\\
  %\alpha_{ind/sp} & \sim N(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma^2_{ind/sp}) \\
  
  %\item \underline{Inter-annual model}:\\
  %y_i &= \alpha_{i} + \beta_{annual precipitation}X_1[_i_] + \epsilon_i\\
  %\epsilon_i & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_y) \\
  
  %\end{enumerate}
  \indent To graphically interpret the interactions in the hierarchical model, we calculated the marginal effects using the R-package ``ggeffects" \citep{Ludecke2018}. Fig. \ref{fig:apcs}a shows the water limitation effect of FLS given are based on the mean flowering date (May 8) in the community and  Fig. \ref{fig:apcs}b shows the flowering time effect on FLS based on mean minimum precipitation values for the species included in the analysis (26 cm). \\
  
  \noindent Though we make comparisons between the various HF and MTSV/USFS case studies, differences in data structure between the datasets required us to use alternative modeling frameworks. The categorical, mean quantitative HF data as well as the MTSV and USFS data provide one response variable for each species while the intra-specific variation HF data contains several different response values per species, among individuals and years. The current phylogenetic generalized linear model framework can only fit models with one response value per species, while the phylogenetic mixed model in brms may over-fit models with this kind of data structure and performs better on multi-response per species datasets like HF \citep{BurknerPC}. At the outset, we ran both model types on each case study and while they do yield different absolute estimates, the patterns we found were consistent across each framework, and we report results from the most appropriate model for each dataset.\\
  
  \subsubsection*{Analyses of phylogenetic signals}
  \noindent For all categorical specifications of FLS (MTSV, USFS and HF), we assessed the phylogenetic structure of hysteranthous flowering with Fritz's D-statistic \citep{FRITZ2010} using the ``Caper" package \citep{Orme2013} in R. Fritz's D calculates the sum of changes in estimated node values of a binary trait along edges in a phylogeny and compares this observed value to both a model of phylogenetic randomness and Brownian threshold model. The means of the two data simulations scale values of D to set points of 0 (as phylogenetically conserved) and 1 (random)  \citep{Orme2013}. We visualized the distribution of the traits across the tree for the MTSV and USFS datasets using the R package ``ggtree" \citep{Yu2017}, (see Fig. \ref{fig:phylogeny}). \\
  
  \noindent For the intra-specific variation Harvard Forest model, we estimated the phylogenetic signal for FLS (lambda) directly from the PMM model. To estimate lambda, we fit an intercept-only model with the phylogeny covariance matrix as a random effect and obtained the intra-class correlation value which is the phylogenetic signal. We also estimated the phylogenetic signal from the full model which included all predictors, and in both cases the intra-class correlation in the residuals were high. Estimated phylogenetic signals from all case studies are reported in (Fig. \ref{fig:Dstat}).  
  
  \subsubsection*{The water limitation hypothesis in wet temperate forests}
  \noindent As mentioned, it is surprising that the water-limitation hypothesis for FLS variation might be applicable in temperate regions where water is rarely limited during the main period of reproductive and vegetative phenological activity \citep{Polgar2011}. While recent work found a strong association between drought tolerance traits and FLS variation \citep{Gougherty2018}, this inconsistency suggests that this hypothesis needs further development to be considered in the temperate zone.\\
  
  \noindent There are a number of modifications to the water limitation hypothesis that may explain its relevance to temperate FLSs. This most simple is that hysteranthy in temperate species reflects a ``memory" of an ancestral existence in drier environments and there is no contemporary function relating to plant water status. Hysteranthy may simply be maintained in temperate flora because there is no or weak selection against it. If this is the case, FLS variability should be independent of contemporary water availability. We modified our hierarchical FLS model to test the effect of variation in annual climatic water balance (precipitation - potential evapotranspiration) at Harvard Forest on interannual FLS variation. We calculated water balance from flux tower measurements at Harvard Forest \citep{Hadley2004}, converting latent heat flux to potential evapotranspiration using the R package ``bigleaf'' \citep{Knauer2018}. We found no significant effect of climatic water balance on FLS variation, further suggesting that FLSs variation seems to be independent of water availability in the temperate zone.\\%EMWJune2020 Check your bib file for why the Hadley2004 shows up with extra punctuation
  
  \noindent A second possibility is that the drought tolerance conferred by hysteranthy in the dry tropics has been re-purposed to serve a different function in the temperate zone. Cold\linelabel{watemp3} tolerance, a critical adaptation for life at higher latitudes, may be conferred by many of the same physiological adaptations as for drought tolerance in dry regions \citep{Zanne2013}. For the species in our analyses, we found a strong correlation (0.85) between minimum precipitation and temperature across species' ranges. It is possible that hysteranthy is among the suite of traits that allowed dry-adapted taxa to move into colder temperate regions. Association between hysteranthy and cold adaptation have been found in some families \citep{Gougherty2018}. Though the mechanism by which hysteranthous flowering may contribute to cold tolerance has not been thoroughly investigated, this correlation remains a promising avenue for applying\linelabel{wat2} the water limitation hypothesis in the temperate zone.\\
