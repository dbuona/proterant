\section*{Summary}
Phenology is a major component of an organism's fitness. While individual phenological events affect fitness, growing evidence suggests that the relationship between events may be equally or more important. This may explain why temperate deciduous woody plants exhibit considerable variation in the order of reproductive and vegetative events, or flower-leaf sequences (FLSs). There is evidence to suggest that FLS may be adaptive\linelabel{small1.r2}, with several competing hypotheses to explain their function. Here, we advance the existing hypotheses with a new framework that accounts for quantitative FLS variation at multiple taxonomic scales using case studies from temperate forests. Our inquiry provides several major insights towards a better understanding of FLS variation. First, we show that concurrent support for multiple hypotheses should be starting point for future FLS analyses. Second, we demonstrate that support for FLS hypotheses is sensitive to how FLSs are defined, with quantitative definitions being the most useful for robust hypothesis testing. Finally, we highlight how adopting a quantitative, intra-specific approach generates new avenues for evaluating fitness consequences of FLS variation and provides cascading benefits to improving predictions of how climate change will alter FLSs and thereby re-shape plant communities and ecosystems.

\section*{Introduction}
Phenology, the timing of seasonal life cycle events allows organisms to synchronize life-history transitions with optimum environmental conditions \citep{Forrest2010}, and is a critical component of ecosystem structure and function \citep{Cleland2007,Piao2007}. It is not only individual\linelabel{small1.r1} phenological stages that affect these processes, but also their chronology \citep{Firmat2017,Vitasse2010,Ettinger2018}.\\

\noindent One phenological relationship that has long received scientific interest \citep[see][]{Robertson1895} and, recently, increased attention \citep[e.g.][]{Savage2019, Gougherty2018} is the flower-leaf phenological sequence (FLS) of temperate deciduous woody plants. In a typical model of plant life-history, vegetative growth precedes reproduction. However, for many species in the forests of Eastern North America (and other temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere), it is not the green tips of new shoots that mark the commencement of the growing season, but the subtle colors of\linelabel{small2.r1} their flowers. Previous work by \citet{Gougherty2018} found that approximately 30\% of tree species of the Midwestern United States flower prior to leafout \linelabel{small3.r1}. The prevalence of this FLS may be surprising as it necessitates reproductive investment from stored carbohydrates at a time when reserves are most depleted \citep{Primack1987} \linelabel{tradeoff1}, but this trade-off suggests that flowering-first has some adaptive significance \citep{Rathcke_1985}.\\  \linelabel{smallx.r2}.

\noindent Understanding this phenological pattern is timely because anthropogenic climate change is altering FLSs. Long-term observations show the number of days between flowering and leafout is increasing as a result of climate change, but the rate of change differs up to five-fold among species, with flowering-first species seemingly more sensitive \linelabel{ser1} to climate change (Fig. \ref{fig:climchange}).  If FLSs are indeed an important component of woody plant fitness, this inter-specific variation will exacerbate fitness differences between species, influencing which species will persist under altered climate conditions.\\ 

\noindent Long-term datasets also demonstrate high within-species variability in FLSs.\linelabel{small4.r1} Despite recent advances in understanding the physiology and evolution of FLSs \citep{Gougherty2018,Savage2019}, most analyses have not directly addressed this variability---potentially slowing progress in predicting how FLS patterns will respond to climate change \linelabel{small5.r1}. While the literature provides some general correlations between flowering and leafing phenology \citep[e.g.][]{Lechowicz_1995, Ettinger2018}, there have been few, if any, analyses of higher-resolution patterns \citep{Gougherty2018}. \\

\noindent We propose a new framework for the study of FLSs built on quantitative measures of both inter- and intra-specific FLS variation. This shift will improve predictions of how FLS patterns will change in the future, and  may reveal novel avenues to better understand the fundamental biology of this important phenological sequence.\\

\noindent Here we 1) review the hypotheses of the function of FLS variation 2) evaluate the biological basis of the current categorical FLS framework and 3) present our proposed quantitative framework using a detailed case study of long-term phenology records from Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA.

\section*{Hypotheses for flower-leaf sequence variation}
\subsubsection*{ Wind pollination}
\noindent The most prevalent FLS hypothesis suggests that flowering-first is an adaptation for wind-pollination, with leafless flowering allowing for more efficient pollen transfer \citep{Whitehead1969}  (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual} a). The primary evidence for this hypothesis comes from pollen diffusion studies \citep[e.g., particle movement through closed and open canopies,][]{Niklas1985, Milleron2012} and suggests canopy structure encumbers pollen movement. %This hypothesis predicts a strong association between FLS and pollination syndrome.
\subsubsection*{Water limitation}
\noindent Another hypothesis suggests that flowering before leaf development is an adaptation to reduce water stress caused by concurrently maintaining floral hydration and leaf transpiration \citep{Franklin2016} (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual} b)). Observations from the dry tropics where this FLS is also common confirm that the timing of flowering in these taxa is associated with a water status recovery due to leaf drop \citep{Borchert1983,Reich1984}. There is also evidence that flower tissue is more resistance to drought\linelabel{hydro} damage than leaf tissue \citep{Zhang2017}. Recent analyses of temperate flora have linked flowering-first with functional traits related to drought tolerance despite the fact that temperate forests are rarely water-limited during the spring \citep{Gougherty2018}. While it is unlikely that \linelabel{freeze} water limitation drives current FLS variation in this region, there is a positive association between drought and freeze tolerance \citep{Zanne2013}, and this may help to explain the prevalence of the flowering-first FLS in the temperate zone. %This hypothesis predicts a strong relationship between FLS and metrics of hydraulic demand.
 
\subsubsection*{Early flowering}
\noindent A third possibility is that the flowering-first FLS is a physiological byproduct of selection for early flowering  (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual} c)). Flowering-first species are among the earliest in a community to flower seasonally, which may be an adaptation to accommodate later phenological events such as the \linelabel{fruit} maturation of large fruits or seeds \citep{Li2016,Primack1987,Ettinger2018}. This may be particularly important at the high latitudes where selection on flowering time is strong due \linelabel{fruit2} to a shorter growing season \citep{MunguiaRosas2011}. Alternatively, early flowering{scher1} may reduce pollination success in the short term, but improve the overall fitness of woody plants by driving interannual variation in seed production as a strategy for predator avoidance \citp{Schermer2020}. Recent work from \citet{Savage2019} demonstrated that spring flower phenology is less constrained by prior phenological events than leaf phenology, which would allow selection to drive flowering into the early season, producing the flowering-first FLS \linelabel{small6.r1}. With this hypothesis there is no specific advantage to a species flowering before or after leafing; all that matters is its absolute flowering time.

\subsubsection*{Phylogenetic and physical constraints}
\noindent \linelabel{constraint1}The previous hypotheses suggest that a flowering-first FLS may be adaptive, but it is possible that the greater diversity of FLS patterns observed in temperate forest communities is the product of phylogenetic, developmental, architectural or physiological constraints among species \citep{Diggle1995,Diggle1999,Schaik1993}  (Fig. \ref{fig:conceptual} d)). For example, the reproductive phenology species that produce flower from axilary buds set in previous season may be more independent of leaf phenology than species with determinate growth \citep{Rathcke_1985,Borchert1983,Schaik1993}. \linelabel{constraint2} Previous work has suggested that xylem anatomy \linelabel{constraint3} may constrain spring phenology \citep{Lechowicz_1995}, though recent work from \citet{Savage2019} determined that unlike leaves, the reproductive buds of many temperate, spring-flowering species are hydrated primarily by the phloem, suggesting the flowering-first FLS may be independent of xylem activity. Generally speaking, architecture and development is highly conserved among species \citep{Diggle1999} and we might expect to see a strong phylogenetic signal for FLS variation as was reported in a recent analysis by \citet{Gougherty2018}. A strong phylogenetic pattern in FLS would not preclude any of the adaptive hypotheses presented above, as  many different evolutionary processes can yield comparable phylogenetic signals \citep{Revell2008}. \\

\noindent While decades of inquiry have advanced each of these hypotheses independently, there is no clear consensus regarding their comparative merits. Most previous studies on FLSs have not compared hypotheses, and those that did have generally found support for multiple \citep[see][]{Bolmgren2003,Gougherty2018}. There is no expectation that the FLS hypotheses must be mutually exclusive. Indeed, understanding the relative importance of each one and the relationships between them may provide the most useful path forward, if they can be robustly compared.\\

\noindent We argue that a sensible reconciliation of these hypotheses is possible with a shift to a new conceptual framework for the study of FLSs. Under the current framework, FLSs are described qualitatively, and prescribed at the species level. We suggest that quantitative measures of FLS which include observations below the species level are more compatible with the biological processes underlying FLS variation. Below we present an overview of the current approach to describing FLSs and highlight some of the challenges that can arise when using it. \\

\section*{The current flower-leaf sequence framework}
\subsection*{Describing FLSs}
\noindent  The current framework describes three main FLS categories: flowers before leaves (hysteranthy, proteranthy, precocious flowering); flowers with leaves (synanthy); and flowers after leaves (seranthy) \citep{Lamont2011, Heinig1899}. Some data sources \citep[e.g.][]{Burns1990,Barnes2004} include additional categories: ``flowers before/with leaves" and ``flowers with/after leaves", but it is unclear whether these categories describe intermediate FLS patterns or FLS variability in these species. While these categories are conceptually reasonable, applying them to real phenological sequences is not always straightforward.\\

\noindent Both reproductive and vegetative phenological sequences consist of multiple sub-stages, and this introduces significant ambiguity into how we interpret qualitative FLS descriptions. Consider a species with the following FLS:\\

\begin{center}
\textbf{flower budburst}$\rightarrow$ \textbf{leaf budburst}$\rightarrow$ \textbf{first flowers open} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{leafout} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{peak flowering} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{end of leaf expansion} \\
\end{center}

\noindent Observers could justifiably classify this species as: 1) Hysteranthous because flower budburst precedes\linelabel{small7.r1} leaf budburst, 2) Synanthous because flowers open during the budburst-leafout inter-phase, 3) Seranthous because peak flowering occurs after leafout. This problem extends beyond this simple example to real datasets, \citep[e.g.][]{OKeefe2015} where the same ambiguities exist (Fig \ref{fig:HFmeans}). Not surprisingly then, different sources may classify the same species differently. We compared species-level FLS descriptions in two of the most comprehensive records of FLS, \underline{Michigan Trees} and its companion volume \underline{Michigan Shrubs and Vines} (MTSV) \citep{Barnes2004,Barnes2016} with \underline{The USFS Silvics Manual Volume II} \citep{Burns1990}. Of the 49 overlapping species, 30\% were classified differently. Such different classifications could reflect interesting temporal or geographic variability in FLSs, but---given current definitions---they could equally be the product of observer classification decisions.\\

\noindent Categorization can often introduce biases in analyses \citep{Royston2006,Edwards2015} and this may be particular prevalent for the study of FLSs. The wind pollination hypothesis hinges on the fact that leaves create a substantial barrier to pollen transfer, which may not be true during the early stages of leaf expansion when tiny leaf primordia would have little impact on environmental structure. Rather, trees that flower during the early stages of leaf expansion should gain similar advantage to those who complete their flowering before any leaf activity (Fig \ref{fig:conceptual}a). Alternatively, because transpiration intensifies as soon as leaves begin to expand \citep{%Breda1996,
Wang2018}, the water limitation \linelabel{lim1} hypothesis asserts there should be\linelabel{small2.r2} a cost to maintaining floral structures during any stage of leaf activity (Fig \ref{fig:conceptual}b).\\ 

\noindent Given the differences in biological processes underlying these hypotheses, statistical relationships between FLS and traits will fluctuate depending on where categorical boundaries are drawn. For the example presented above, we would expect to see the strongest signal of the wind-pollination hypothesis when the category of hysteranthy includes species that flower before and with early leaf development. The strongest signal for the water limitation \linelabel{lim2} hypothesis should occur when the hysteranthous classification is restricted to only species that flower before any leaf activity. If these hypotheses require different categorization schemes to accurately capture the underlying biology, it becomes difficult to compare them in the same modeling framework.\\

\noindent For both the MTSV and USFS datasets, we found that associations between FLSs and functional traits were highly sensitive to how FLSs were defined (Supporting Information Fig: \ref{fig:muplots.USMT}, e.g. pollination syndrome, Supporting Information Fig: \ref{fig:Dstat}). For both datasets, we applied two alternative FLS categorizations; physiological hysteranthy, which allowed for no overlap between floral and leaf phenophases, and functional hysteranthy, which allowed for a degree of overlap (see Supporting Information \nameref{Methods S1}). These alternate categorization boundaries re-shuffled the species included in each classification, affecting both the trait distributions within each category and the phylogenetic patterning across the tree (Supporting Information Fig. \ref{fig:phylogeny}).\\ 
 
\noindent These findings suggest that a new approach that relaxes the assumptions of categorization could help to fairly evaluate FLS hypotheses. Below we present a new framework for the study of FLSs built on 1) quantitative measures and 2) intra-specific investigations of FLS variation. This simple shift can increase the precision of FLS descriptions, capture biological variation neglected by common-use approaches, and offer novel avenues for understanding the scope and consequences of FLS variation in an era of global change.

 
\section*{A new framework for flower-leaf sequences} 

\subsection*{Quantitative measures of FLS}

\noindent In the current FLS framework species are classified based on sequence alone. The duration of and time between phases, however, also matters \citep{Inouye2019}. When considering measures of time, FLSs of species within each category can be quite different (Fig. \ref{fig:vizzy}a). Measure of FLS based on continuous data---i.e. reporting the number of days between specific phenophases, suggest there is much greater diversity in FLS patterns in a given forest community than provided by the three categories of the current framework.\\ 

\noindent quantitative measures of FLSs should improve FLS-trait association models like the ones presented above by reducing the noise associated with this unmeasured variation. We used long-term phenological records for woody species at Harvard Forest \citep{OKeefe2015} to model the associations between FLS and functional traits using both categorical FLS descriptions and a simple quantitative metric; the mean number of days between flower and leaf budburst for each species (see Supporting Information \nameref{Methods S1}). The functional traits used to represent each hypothesis can be found in the Supporting Information (Tab. \ref{}).  In all cases, results from models with alternative predictors were comparable to the main results and can be viewed in the Supporting Information (Fig. \ref{altmodels}).\\

\noindent Using the categorical approach, the model detected only a weak relationship between hysteranthy and wind-pollination. However, the increased inter-specific variation captured with the quantitative approach suggests increasing time between flower and leaf budburst is strongly associated with wind-pollination and early flowering, and that the longest FLS interphases are found in species with both of these traits (Fig. \ref{fig:muplots.HF}a),b).\\

\noindent Along with this increased precision, quantitative measures of phenology \citep[e.g. the BBCH scale,][]{Finn2007} do not only precisely standardize data across time and space, observer, and analyst. This facilitates comparing FLS patterns across larger temporal and geographic scales, giving researchers more power to accurately address questions about FLS variation.\\

\noindent Perhaps one of the most promising additional aspects of a quantitative approach to FLSs is that it allows for variation to be evaluated below the species level. We argue that intra-specific inquiries into FLS variation are vital to thoroughly answer both the questions about the basic mechanisms that generate FLS variation, and the applied questions regarding the magnitude and impact of FLS shifts with climate change.

\subsection*{Intra-specific data on FLSs}
\noindent Quantitative measurements of FLSs reveal significant variation among populations, individuals and years (Fig. \ref{fig:vizzy} b)-d)). This variation can be leveraged to improved FLS trait models at the species level, and to generate and test novel questions about the fitness value of this trait.\\

\noindent Observations at multiple taxonomic scales should further improve FLS-trait association models by allowing researchers to explicitly incorporate multiple levels of variation (i.e. through hierarchical modeling). We re-analyzed the same FLS data from Harvard Forest presented above using a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporated within-species variation in FLSs and flowering time (see Supporting Information \nameref{Methods S1}).\\

\noindent As in the model based on species' mean trait values, we found strong effects of flowering time, pollination syndrome and phylogeny on FLS variation, with only a weak signal for the water limitation \linelabel{lim3} hypothesis (Fig. \ref{fig:muplots.HF}, Fig. Supporting Information \ref{fig:Dstat}). However, with accounting for intra-specific variation we identified strong interactions between other predictors. Of note, we found the effect of early flowering on FLS variation was more pronounced in wind-pollinated taxa, and that hydraulic demand \linelabel{lim4} was associated with increased time between flowering and leafing in biotically-pollinated taxa but not wind-pollinated taxa (Fig. \ref{fig:apcs}).\\

\noindent While all analyses\linelabel{sens1} are inherently sensitive to the choice sub-phases investigated, incorporating intra-specific variation into the modeling appeared to reduces this bias (see Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity}). This is important because it may allow researcher to robustly compare existing FLS data that \linelabel{sens2}may be based on separate, but related sub-phases.\\

\noindent Our findings suggest that the tendency for previous studies to find support for multiple hypotheses \citep{Bolmgren2003,Gougherty2018,Savage2019} is consistent with the biological processes that shape FLSs. Multiple hypotheses should be the starting point for future FLS research. While large scale analyses may continue to be beneficial, a more nuanced understanding about function of FLS variation may result from pattern deconstruction \citep[i.e. grouping of species according to sub-clades or trait commonalities][]{Terribile2009}. For example,% many of the hysteranthous, biotically-pollinated temperate species trace their bio-geographic origins \linelabel{spec1} to the tropical regions \citep{Daubenmire1972} in which the water limitation hypothesis originated \citep{Janzen1967,Franklin2016}. This observation, coupled with the high levels of phylogentic conservatism in FLSs suggests that the evolution of hysteranthy in these taxa my have followed quite a different tradjectory than in the hysteranthous wind-pollinated species which evolved primarily in the temperate zone \citep{Whitehad1969}. Whether or not this is the case, 
it is clear that wind-pollination efficiency is not driving hysteranthous flowering in insect-pollinated taxa, so considering this group of species alone rules out one major FLS hypothesis, allowing for a better evaluation of alternatives. 

\subsection*{Linking FLS variation to fitness}
\noindnent While trait associations \linelabel{intrasoup}point to past selection, much of the current interest in FLSs relates to how shifting FLS patterns will impact woody plants in the future. To this end, intra-specific FLS data is instructive. \linelabel{pop1} Population level variation is critical to better understand the specifics of how environmental conditions shape FLSs \citep{Vitasse2009}, and how FLS variation interacts with landscape scale processes like gene flow and dispersal \citep{Manel2003}. Variation among and within individuals provides insights regarding  micro-climate effects, heritability, selection and plasticity for FLSs \citep{Denechere2019}. \linelabel{pop2} Taken together, investigations at these lower taxonomic levels could provide a more robust assessment of the potential magnitude of FLS shifts with climate change.\\

\noindent Intra-specific inquiry is a critical step to better understand the consequences of FLS shifts. At the core of each FLS hypothesis is a fitness prediction that is best interrogated below the species level. If FLSs are functionally important, individual variability in FLSs should correlated with changes in performance as\linelabel{scher2} has been shown for other phenophases \citep[e.g.][]{Schermer2020}. For example, in the case of FLS, the wind-pollination hypothesis suggests that decreasing the time between flowering and leafing should result in reduced pollination success. If individual FLS variation \linelabel{exp1} was tracked in the field or controlled environments along with, for example, reproductive outcomes such as pollination success or fruit set, these kinds of predictions could be\linelabel{intrasoup2} directly assessed. Evaluating the relationship between FLS variation and performance is critical to determine whether at its biological core, FLS variation is merely an interesting natural history note\linelabel{consequence} of temperate forests or an important functional trait that will impact the structure and function of these communities in the future.\\ 

\noindent In demonstrating our proposed framework for the study of FLSs we found that, in accordance with previous work, flowering time and pollination syndrome are important drivers of hysteranthy \citep{Gougherty2018}. Our work adds to the growing literature that infers the adaptive significance of FLSs from macro-evolutionary patterns and opens new avenues for testing the effects of FLS variation on woody plant performance below the species level. While it is clear the FLSs are highly variable and shifting with global climate change, research must directly examine the effects of FLS variation to better assess the consequences of future FLS shifts.\\

\noindent While much of research on the evolution of plant phenology focuses on specific phenophases \citep[e.g.][]{Savage2013,OLLERTON_1992}, in this paper, we examined the evolutionary drivers of a phenological sequence. With growing evidence that adaptation drives both the absolute timing of individual phenophases and the relative timing between them we must continue to develop analytical tools that improve our understanding of the drivers of phenological events as part of a phenological syndrome, rather than as discrete, separate events. 
Our treatment of FLSs here is a small part of this work, but understanding how selection shapes phenology both throughout the whole growing season and across years remains a major frontier for the study of phenology \citep{Wolkovich2014b}. This is an essential step towards a more complete understanding of the fundamental biology of temperate woody plants, and for predicting the fate of these species as global climate continues to change.

These model projections are conditioned on long term phenological data from Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA \citep{OKeefe2015} and reflect a fixed flowering time in early May (approximately the overall long-term average in the community) for both functional types. These systematic differences in drivers of FLSs could reflect greater differences in the bio-geographic histories of the wind and biotically-pollinated taxa of temperate forest communities.}
