Biological inference in comparing HF to HF bin directly
Note: should run bin models with species hysteranthy fixed

1. We see that flowering times relative stength is much bigger
2. We see interactions emerge like between drought tolerance and pollination syndrome and time pollination syndrome is super additive. This helps us with clarification of wph. Hysteranthus species must flower before community leaf out, not just themselves.
