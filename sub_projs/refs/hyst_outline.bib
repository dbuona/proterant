	Abstract = {Differences in phenological responses to climate change among species can desynchronise ecological interactions and thereby threaten ecosystem function. To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5--2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1--14.8 days earlier on average).},

	N2 = {Abstract Recent shifts in phenology are the best documented biological response to current anthropogenic climate change, yet remain poorly understood from a functional point of view. Prevailing analyses are phenomenological and approximate, only correlating temperature records to imprecise records of phenological events. To advance our understanding of phenological responses to climate change, we developed, calibrated, and validated process-based models of leaf unfolding for 22 North American tree species. Using daily meteorological data predicted by two scenarios (A2: +3.2?$\,^{\circ}$C and B2: +1?$\,^{\circ}$C) from the HadCM3 GCM, we predicted and compared range-wide shifts of leaf unfolding in the 20th and 21st centuries for each species. Model predictions suggest that climate change will affect leaf phenology in almost all species studied, with an average advancement during the 21st century of 5.0 days in the A2 scenario and 9.2 days in the B2 scenario. Our model also suggests that lack of sufficient chilling temperatures to break bud dormancy will decrease the rate of advancement in leaf unfolding date during the 21st century for many species. Some temperate species may even have years with abnormal budburst due to insufficient chilling. Species fell into two groups based on their sensitivity to climate change: (1) species that consistently had a greater advance in their leaf unfolding date with increasing latitude and (2) species in which the advance in leaf unfolding differed from the center to the northern vs. southern margins of their range. At the interspecific level, we predicted that early-leafing species tended to show a greater advance in leaf unfolding date than late-leafing species; and that species with larger ranges tend to show stronger phenological changes. These predicted changes in phenology have significant implications for the frost susceptibility of species, their interspecific relationships, and their distributional shifts.},

	Abstract = {A monthly dataset of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from 1870 to 2002 is derived using historical precipitation and temperature data for global land areas on a 2.5$\,^{\circ}$grid. Over Illinois, Mongolia, and parts of China and the former Soviet Union, where soil moisture data are available, the PDSI is significantly correlated (r = 0.5 to 0.7) with observed soil moisture content within the top 1-m depth during warm-season months. The strongest correlation is in late summer and autumn, and the weakest correlation is in spring, when snowmelt plays an important role. Basin-averaged annual PDSI covary closely (r = 0.6 to 0.8) with streamflow for seven of world's largest rivers and several smaller rivers examined. The results suggest that the PDSI is a good proxy of both surface moisture conditions and streamflow. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the PDSI reveals a fairly linear trend resulting from trends in precipitation and surface temperature and an El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-induced mode of mostly interannual variations as the two leading patterns. The global very dry areas, defined as PDSI {$<$} −3.0, have more than doubled since the 1970s, with a large jump in the early 1980s due to an ENSO-induced precipitation decrease and a subsequent expansion primarily due to surface warming, while global very wet areas (PDSI {$>$} +3.0) declined slightly during the 1980s. Together, the global land areas in either very dry or very wet conditions have increased from ∼20{\%} to 38{\%} since 1972, with surface warming as the primary cause after the mid-1980s. These results provide observational evidence for the increasing risk of droughts as anthropogenic global warming progresses and produces both increased temperatures and increased drying.},

	Abstract = {Prunus subg. Prunus sect. Prunocerasus (Rosaceae) is a North American taxon with 17 commonly recognized taxa. To test the hypothesis of monophyly for the section we sequenced the trnG and rpL16 introns and the trnH-psbA and trnS-trnG intergenic spacers for at least two representatives of each of the five subgenera in Prunus. Additionally we sampled heavily among Prunus subg. Prunus sections Prunus and Armeniaca and Prunus subg. Amygdalus because these groups are putatively most closely related to Prunocerasus. Once monophyly of sect. Prunocerasus was shown we added the sequences of trnL and rpS16 introns and the trnL-trnF spacer in an attempt to increase resolution within the section. The species of sect. Prunocerasus showed an initial split with P. subcordata, the only species from western North America, sister to the rest of the group. The remaining species fell into three primary clades. Within each of the three primary clades there was little phylogenetic resolution. Lastly, we present evidence that P. texana, previously classified in subg. Amygdalus, may be a plum or at least contain a Prunocerasus chloroplast. This is the first phylogenetic hypothesis presented for sect. Prunocerasus, and the clades recovered contrast sharply with previously defined groups based on morphological characters.},

	N2 = {Climate change, with both warmer spring temperatures and greater temperature fluctuations, has altered phenologies, possibly leading to greater risk of spring frost damage to temperate deciduous woody plants. Phenological observations of 20 woody species from 1993 to 2012 in Trelease Woods, Champaign County, Illinois, USA, were used to identify years with frost damage to vegetative and reproductive phases. Local temperature records were used in combination with the phenological observations to determine what combinations of the two were associated with damage. Finally, a long-term temperature record (1889?1992) was evaluated to determine if the frequency of frost damage has risen in recent decades. Frost ≤?1.7$\,^{\circ}$C occurred after bud-break in 14 of the 20 years of observation. Frost damage occurred in five years in the interior and in three additional years at only the forest edge. The degree of damage varied with species, life stage, tissue (vegetative or reproductive), and phenological phase. Common features associated with the occurrence of damage to interior plants were (1) a period of unusual warm temperatures in March, followed by (2) a frost event in April with a minimum temperature ≤?6.1$\,^{\circ}$C with (3) a period of 16?33 days between the extremes. In the long-term record, 10 of 124 years met these conditions, but the yearly probability of frost damage increased significantly, from 0.03 during 1889?1979 to 0.21 during 1980?2012. When the criteria were ?softened? to ≤?1.7$\,^{\circ}$C in April and an interval of 16?37 days, 31 of 124 years met the conditions, and the yearly damage probability increased significantly to 0.19 for 1889?1979 and 0.42 for 1980?2012. In this forest, the combination of warming trends and temperature variability (extremes) associated with climate change is having ecologically important effects, making previously rare frost damage events more common.},

	N2 = {Abstract The onset of the growing season of trees has been earlier by 2.3 days per decade during the last 40 years in temperate Europe because of global warming. The effect of temperature on plant phenology is, however, not linear because temperature has a dual effect on bud development. On one hand, low temperatures are necessary to break bud endodormancy, and, on the other hand, higher temperatures are necessary to promote bud cell growth afterward. Different process-based models have been developed in the last decades to predict the date of budbreak of woody species. They predict that global warming should delay or compromise endodormancy break at the species equatorward range limits leading to a delay or even impossibility to flower or set new leaves. These models are classically parameterized with flowering or budbreak dates only, with no information on the endodormancy break date because this information is very scarce. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of a set of phenological models to accurately predict the endodormancy break dates of three fruit trees. Our results show that models calibrated solely with budbreak dates usually do not accurately predict the endodormancy break date. Providing endodormancy break date for the model parameterization results in much more accurate prediction of this latter, with, however, a higher error than that on budbreak dates. Most importantly, we show that models not calibrated with endodormancy break dates can generate large discrepancies in forecasted budbreak dates when using climate scenarios as compared to models calibrated with endodormancy break dates. This discrepancy increases with mean annual temperature and is therefore the strongest after 2050 in the southernmost regions. Our results claim for the urgent need of massive measurements of endodormancy break dates in forest and fruit trees to yield more robust projections of phenological changes in a near future.},

	N2 = {Warming climates have been widely recognized to advance spring vegetation phenology. However, the delayed responses of vegetation phenology to rising temperature and their mechanisms are poorly understood. Using satellite and climate data from 1982 to 2005, we reveal a latitude transition zone of greenup onset in vegetation communities that has diversely responded to warming temperature in North America. From 40$\,^{\circ}$N northwards, a winter chilling requirement for vegetation dormancy release is far exceeded and the decrease in chilling days by warming winter temperature has little impact on thermal-time requirements for greenup onset. Thus, warming spring temperature has constantly advanced greenup onset by 0.32 days/year. However, from 40$\,^{\circ}$N southward, the shortened winter chilling days are insufficient for fulfilling vegetation chilling requirement, so that the thermal-time requirement for greenup onset during spring increases gradually. Consequently, vegetation greenup onset changes progressively from an early trend (north region) to a later trend (south region) along the latitude transition zone from 40?31$\,^{\circ}$N, where the switch occurs around 35$\,^{\circ}$N. The greenup onset is delayed by 0.15 days/year below 31$\,^{\circ}$N.},

	Abstract = {Insufficient chilling resulting from rising winter temperatures associated with climate warming has been an area of particular interest in boreal and temperate regions where a period of cool temperatures in fall and winter is required to break plant dormancy. In this study, we examined the budburst and growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud.) seedlings subjected to typical northern Ontario, Canada, spring conditions in climate chambers after different exposures to natural chilling. Results indicate that chilling requirements (cumulative weighted chilling hours) differed substantially among the seven species, ranging from 300 to 500 h for spruce seedlings to more than 1100 h for trembling aspen and lodgepole pine. Only spruce seedlings had fulfilled their chilling requirements before December 31, whereas the other species continued chilling well into March and April. Species with lower chilling requirements needed more heat accumulation for budburst and vice versa. Insufficient chilling delayed budburst but only extremely restricted chilling hours (<400) resulted in abnormal budburst and growth, including reduced needle and shoot expansion, early budburst in lower crowns, and erratic budburst on lower stems and roots. Effects, however, depended on both the species' chilling requirements and the chilling--heat relationship. Among the seven tree species examined, trembling aspen is most likely to be affected by reduced chilling accumulation possible under future climate scenarios, followed by balsam poplar, white birch, lodgepole pine, and jack pine. Black and white spruce are least likely to be affected by changes in chilling hours.},

	Abstract = {The phenology of plants is a major driver of agro-ecosystem processes and biosphere feedbacks to the climate system. Phenology models are classically used in ecology and agronomy to project future phenological changes. With our increasing understanding of the environmental cues affecting bud development, phenology models also increase in complexity. But, we expect these cues, and the underlying physiological processes, to have varying influence on bud break date predictions depending on the specific weather patterns in winter and spring. Here, we evaluated the parameter sensitivity of state-of-the-art process-based phenology models that have been widely used to predict forest tree species phenology. We used sensitivity analysis to compare the behavior of models with increasing complexity under specific climatic conditions. We thus assessed whether the influence of the parameters and modeled processes on predictions varies with winter and spring temperatures. We found that the prediction of the bud break date was mainly affected by the response to forcing temperature under current climatic conditions. However, the impact of the parameters driving the response to chilling temperatures and to photoperiod on the prediction of the models increased with warmer winter and spring temperatures. Interaction effects between parameters played an important role on the prediction of models, especially for the most complex models, but did not affect the relative influence of parameters on bud break dates. Our results highlighted that a stronger focus should be given to the characterization of the reaction norms to both forcing and chilling temperature to predict accurately bud break dates in a larger range of climatic conditions and evaluate the evolutionary potential of phenological traits with climate change.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}Models of atmospheric dispersal of anemophilous pollen are important tools in Quaternary plant ecology for determining pollen-source areas and for applying distance-weightings to vegetation data in formal pollen-vegetation calibrations. The most widely applied model is Prentice's model, which uses a modified form of Sutton's equation for atmospheric diffusion to predict pollen-source areas from size of the depositional basin and a set of depositional parameters (deposition velocity of the pollen grains and mean wind speed) and atmospheric parameters (turbulence parameter, vertical diffusion coefficient). We review the physical theory underlying Sutton's equation and Prentice's model, explore the effects of different values of the depositional and atmospheric parameters on model predictions, and provide prescriptions for model application, parameter specification, and further research on pollen dispersal. Most applications of the models to pollen dispersal have assumed neutral atmospheric conditions. We argue that most pollen dispersal takes place in unstable atmospheric conditions, and prescribe appropriate values for the atmospheric parameters for unstable conditions. Our simulations using these parameters indicate more widespread pollen dispersal from a source than under neutral conditions. We review available data sets for sedimentation velocity of pollen grains, and compare the measured estimates with sedimentation velocities predicted from Stokes's Law to assess validity of the data. Substantial variability exists among data sets, but several are suitable for application to pollen-dispersal models. Finally, we discuss aspects of release, dispersal, and deposition of anemophilous pollen that are in need of further theoretical and empirical study. Such studies will contribute not only to Quaternary plant ecology but also to understanding of pollination biology, population genetics, and functional morphology of pollen grains and pollen-bearing organs. /// Modelle f{\"u}r die atmosph{\"a}rische Verteilung windverbreiteten Pollens sind wichtige Werkzeuge der Quart{\"a}r-Pflanzen{\"o}kologie zur Bestimmung von Polleneinzugsgebieten und um bei der mathematischen Kalibrierung des Zusammenhangs zwischen Pollen und Vegetation die Gewichtung von Entfernungen auf Vegetationsdaten anzuwenden. Das am h{\"a}ufigsten angewendente Modell ist das von Prentice, das eine angepa{\ss}te Form von Suttons Gleichung f{\"u}r atmosph{\"a}rische Diffusion benutzt um Polleneinzugsgebiete auf Grundlage der Gr{\"o}{\ss}e des Ablagerungsbeckens und einer Reihe von Ablagerungsparametern (Sinkgeschwindigkeit, vertikaler Diffusionskoeffizient) vorauszusagen. Wir besprechen die physikalische Theorie, die hinter Suttons und Prentices Modell steht, untersuchen, welchen Einflu{\ss}Ablagerungsparameter unterschiedler Gr{\"o}{\ss}e sowie die atmosph{\"a}rischen Parameter auf die Modellvorhersagen haben und geben Empfehlungen f{\"u}r die Anwendung der Modelle, Spezifizierung der Parameter und weiterf{\"u}hrende Forschung zur Pollenverbreitung. Die meisten Anwendungen von Modellen zur Pollenausbreitung gehen von neutraler thermischer Schichtung aus. Wir er{\"o}rtern, da{\ss}ein Gro{\ss}teil der Pollenablagerung unter unstabilen Schichtungsverh{\"a}ltnissen stattfindet und beschreiben angemessene Werte f{\"u}r die atmosph{\"a}rischen Parameter unter unstabilen Schichtungsverh{\"a}ltnissen. Unsere Simulationen, die diese Parameter benutzen, deuten darauf hin, da{\ss}eine weitere Pollenausbreitung von der Quelle aus stattfindet als bei neutraler Schichtung. Wir {\"u}berpr{\"u}fen verf{\"u}gbare Datens{\"a}tze zur Sinkgeschwindigkeit von Pollenk{\"o}rnern und vergleichen die gemessenen Werte mit den Fallgeschwindigkeiten, die von Stokes Gesetz vorhergesagt werden, um die Richtigkeit der Daten zu beurteilen. Zwischen den Datens{\"a}tzen bestehen betr{\"a}chtlichte Unterschiede, aber einige sind f{\"u}r die Anwendung auf Pollenausbreitungs-Modelle geignet. Sclie{\ss}lich diskutieren wir die Aspekte der Freisetzung, Verbreitung und Ablagernug windverbreiteten Pollens, welche weitergehender theoretischer und empirischer Untersuchung bed{\"u}rfen. Solche Untersuchungen werden nicht nur zur Quart{\"a}r-Pflanzen{\"o}kologie, sondern auch zum Verst{\"a}ndnis von Best{\"a}ubungsbiologie, Populationsgenetik und funktioneller Morphologie von Pollenk{\"o}rnern und pollentragenden Organen beitragen.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {{Few studies have focused on the response of plant community phenology to
   temperature change using manipulative experiments. A lack of
   understanding of whether responses of community reproductive and
   vegetative phenological sequences to warming and cooling are
   asymmetrical or symmetrical limits our capacity to predict responses
   under warming and cooling. A reciprocal transplant experiment was
   conducted for 3 years to evaluate response patterns of the temperature
   sensitivities of community phenological sequences to warming
   (transferred downward) and cooling (transferred upward) along four
   elevations on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that the temperature
   sensitivities of flowering stages had asymmetric responses to warming
   and cooling, whereas symmetric responses to warming and cooling were
   observed for the vegetative phenological sequences. Our findings showed
   that coverage changes of flowering functional groups (FFGs; i.e.,
   early-spring FFG, mid-summer FFG, and late-autumn FFG) and their
   compensation effects combined with required accumulated soil
   temperatureto codetermined the asymmetric and symmetric responses of
   community phenological sequences to warming and cooling. These results
   suggest that coverage change in FFGs on warming and cooling processes
   can be a primary driver of community phenological variation and may lead
   to inaccurate phenlogical estimation at large scale, such as based on

While individual phenological events affect fitness, there is growing evidence to suggest that the relationship between events could be equally or more important. This could explain why temperate deciduous woody plants exhibit considerable variation in the order of reproductive and vegetative events, or flower?leaf sequences (FLSs). There is evidence to suggest that FLSs may be adaptive, with several competing hypotheses to explain their function. Here, we advance existing hypotheses with a new framework that accounts for quantitative FLS variation at multiple taxonomic scales using case studies from temperate forests. Our inquiry provides several major insights towards a better understanding of FLS variation. First, we show that support for FLS hypotheses is sensitive to how FLSs are defined, with quantitative definitions being the most useful for robust hypothesis testing. Second, we demonstrate that concurrent support for multiple hypotheses should be the starting point for future FLS analyses. Finally, we highlight how adopting a quantitative, intraspecific approach generates new avenues for evaluating fitness consequences of FLS variation and provides cascading benefits to improving predictions of how climate change will alter FLSs and thereby reshape plant communities and ecosystems.},

For diverse wind-dispersed and wind-pollinated organisms, regional wind patterns could either facilitate or hinder these movements, depending on alignment of winds with spatial climate patterns. We map global variation in terrestrial wind regimes, and model how `windscape'connectivity will shape inbound and outbound dispersal between sites and their predicted future climate analogs. This model predicts that wind-accessible, climatically analogous sites will be scarcer in locations such as the tropics and on the leeward sides of mountain ranges, implying that the wind-dispersed biota in these landscapes may be more vulnerable to future climate change. A case study of Pinus contorta illustrates species-specific patterns of predicted genetic rescue and range expansion facilitated by wind.

	Abstract = {{Numerous abiotic factors have an important impact on the phenology of
   woody plants with temperature as the main driver of their development.
   Furthermore, the biological factors connected with phenotypic plasticity
   and genetic heterogeneity might be the cause of differentiation in
   phenological response to abiotic factors. As objects of our study, we
   chose black alder and silver birch trees. The main aims of the study
   were to demonstrate the spatial and temporal diversity in the timing of
   Alnus glutinosa and Betula pendula pollination as well as to identify
   factors affecting these variations. We focused on abiotic factors such
   as thermal conditions: air and surface temperatures, within and between
   population variability. Phenological observations were carried out in
   Rzeszow (SE Poland) in a period of four years at over a dozen locations.
   Stands differed in their thermal conditions and prevalent land use
   types. The pollination pattern in the study area was presented against
   the background of local thermal conditions which were described by Land
   Surface Temperature (LST) and maximum daily air temperature. LST was
   estimated with a single-channel algorithm using satellite images
   obtained from Landsat 7 and 8. Our results showed great spatial and
   temporal diversity in the pollination pattern in the study area.
   Year-to-year variations in the B. pendula pollination pattern were less
   pronounced than in the case of A. glutinosa. The pollination pattern was
   strongly influenced by temperature before and during pollination. In the
   study area, the variability of LST was greater than that of air
   temperature but the relationships between the timing of pollination
   phenophases and LST or land use types were weak. It was observed that
   the same sites were similar in their pollination pattern - the timing of
   phenophases was `accelerated' or `delayed' during the whole study
   period. The same individuals were the first or the last that began to
   pollinate independently of the year. We concluded that despite the
   impact of temperature on A. glutinosa and B. pendula development, the
   phenotype of an individual tree might be as important for phenological
   variability as local climate.}},

We used phenological records from Oulainen-Ohineva (64$\,^{\circ}$13′N, 24$\,^{\circ}$53′E) in central Finland from 1953 to 2002 to estimate model parameters. We tested the models with data collected in all but six years between 1896 and 2002 in southern and central Finland; we divided this dataset into two 50-year datasets. The use of three datasets enabled us to test the models with data that were independent of the parameter fitting data, facilitating robust evaluation of model performance. Several models that fitted the parameterization data well showed poorer performance when tested with the independent data. This may be because the models were over-parameterized and able to adapt to noise in the data in addition to the phenological phenomenon itself. Simple Thermal Time models performed best with independent data, and Sequential and Parallel models were similar in prediction accuracy. Although Thermal Time models simulated boreal phenological events under current climatic conditions, some precautions are needed with simulations of climatic warming. For example, changed conditions may increase the relative importance of chilling in the timing of bud burst under elevated temperature conditions, which could alter the performance of phenological models.},

Differences between years were accompanied by different climatic conditions and may have been caused by different levels of pollinator activity. Within blooming seasons, fruit production and pollen receipt declined at all sites with date, accompanying canopy closure. Pollen removal varied with date, but not in parallel with pollen receipt, indicating that pollen receipt and deposition were influenced, in part, by different factors. Of three weather variables examined, ambient temperature was significantly positively correlated with rate of floral development, but not consistently with pollen receipt, pollen removal or fruit production. Pollen receipt was inversely related to cloud cover, presumably due to effects of the latter on pollinator activity. The earliest-blooming plants had the highest reproductive success.},

	N2 = {Increasing risk of pollinosis (hay fever) is one of the most anticipated consequences of climate change on human health. Wind-pollinated plants are representative of allergenic species because they include species with the highest capability of causing allergy-related diseases in humans. Therefore, changes in wind-pollinated species may reflect impacts of climate change on allergenic plants. In particular, flowering is one of the developmental stages most affected by climate change. This report specifically addresses changes in flowering dates that have occurred during the three decades 1971?2000 as a function of pollination mode and woodiness. The assessment is made using a phenological data set comprising trends of flowering dates of 29 species in 983 locations in Europe. Linear mixed models assessing the statistical significance of trends while adjusting for spatial correlation are used. The main results indicate for the first time that the onset of flowering of wind-pollinated plants advanced more than for insect-pollinated plants, while full flowering phases tended to advance less. These novel findings are contrary to the results of Fitter and Fitter (2002) for Oxfordshire, who reported larger advances of insect-pollinated plants. Onset of flowering and full flowering of insect-pollinated species are more likely to advance for seasons early in the year; instead, wind-pollinated plants showed no dependence of trends on the season (first flowering) or a decreased advance of phases that are early in the year (full flowering). The effect of woodiness could not be unambiguously defined, but seems to be of minor importance. The presented findings suggest a lengthening of the flowering period in general, which might lead to an increasing time of exposure to airborne pollen of allergic subjects, with consequent likely increment in severity and incidence of allergic symptoms.},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

	Abstract = {Understanding spatiotemporal variation in environmental conditions is important to determine how climate change will impact ecological communities. The spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature can have strong impacts on community structure and persistence by increasing the duration and the magnitude of unfavorable conditions in sink populations and disrupting spatial rescue effects by synchronizing spatially segregated populations. Although increases in spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature have been documented in historical data, little is known about how climate change will impact these trends. We examined daily air temperature data from 21 General Circulation Models under the business-as-usual carbon emission scenario to quantify patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation between 1871 and 2099. Although both spatial and temporal autocorrelation increased over time, there was significant regional variation in the temporal autocorrelation trends. Additionally, we found a consistent breakpoint in the relationship between spatial autocorrelation and time around the year 2030, indicating an acceleration in the rate of increase of the spatial autocorrelation over the second half of the 21st century. Overall, our results suggest that ecological populations might experience elevated extinction risk under climate change because increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature is expected to erode both spatial and temporal refugia.},

	N2 = {Abstract Many temperate herbs now flower earlier than a few decades ago. Little is known about other phenological events, despite the importance of life history integration for plant fitness. This study addresses the hypothesis that temporal shifts of multiple phenological events in herbs are concordant with temporal changes in weather. Explicitly showing that changes in timing of annual life cycle events are correlated with changes in weather-predicting variables provides support for the hypothesis that a phenological shift is concordant with climate change. Observations of six phenological events and five phenophases were made year-round for 25 yr for herb species in a deciduous forest fragment, Trelease Woods in Illinois, USA. Dates for 43 species were analyzed by linear mixed-effects models for events and phenophases and were compared to weather data from a nearby station. For early species, emergence was delayed by 1.5 d/decade, while end expansion advanced by 3.8 d/decade and begin dormancy advanced by 2.5 d/decade. For late species, end expansion advanced by 6.7 d/decade, while begin senescence delayed by 17.7 d/decade. Begin flowering and end flowering advanced similarly for both seasonal groups, at 3.8 to 4.2 d/decade. Some events showed no temporal change. Species differed greatly in the degree or direction of change, related to seasonality of event or length of phase. Overall, for a given species, most events are advancing (68.4{\%}) and most durations are shortening (74.4{\%}). In 12 of 13 cases, inter-annual variation in event date was predicted by a temperature-event?season combination variable, but in only six cases did both event date shift and weather variable warm through time. This finding supports the hypothesis that climate change is associated with changes in some, but not all, phenological events. This first long-term, multi-phase study of a community of temperate herb species indicates little temporal coherence of responses of multiple phases. Changes in date are event specific, phase specific, and species specific. This complexity of responses among species and uneven responses within a species? integrated annual cycle events has implications for evolutionary responses and more immediate interactions among plant, animal, and microbe species in this community.},

@article{Albrecht:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Mesic deciduous forest herbs often disperse seed with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) that prevents germination during unfavorable periods for seedling survival. However, for seeds of some species with MPD, seasonal separation of root and shoot emergence and variation in dormancy levels can complicate interpretation of seedling emergence timing in the field. We tested whether dormancy-break and germination requirements differed among co-occurring perennial forest herbs, Actaea racemosa, Hydrastis canadensis, and Sanguinaria canadensis, which are wild-harvested for their medicinal properties and known to have MPD. Seeds of all species exhibited a summer →autumn →winter requirement for seedling emergence in spring. However, species differed in seed-bank persistence due to variation in primary dormancy levels and stratification requirement of seeds. A. racemosa and H. canadensis can form short-term persistent seed bank, whereas S. canadensis can form a long-term persistent seed-bank, regardless of whether elaiosomes were removed from seeds prior to burial. A. racemosa seeds are dispersed in autumn with weak physiological dormancy, as seeds germinated to high rates at 15/6$\,^{\circ}$C after 8 weeks. In contrast, most seeds of the summer dispersed species, H. canadensis and S. canadensis, require summer temperatures to overcome physiological dormancy. Consequently, seedling emergence is reduced and delayed by 1 year if seeds are not sown immediately following the period of natural dispersal. Seedling emergence was much lower in the field than in controlled conditions for all species, especially in the small-seeded A. racemosa. Interspecific variation in dormancy levels and germination traits must be considered when establishing populations for conservation purposes and in understanding recruitment limitation in perennial forest herbs.},

	Abstract = {{Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many physical
   and biological systems; in particular, terrestrial ecosystems provide a
   consistent picture of observed changes. One of the preferred indicators
   is phenology, the science of natural recurring events, as their recorded
   dates provide a high-temporal resolution of ongoing changes. Thus,
   numerous analyses have demonstrated an earlier onset of spring events
   for mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the growing season.
   However, published single-site or single-species studies are
   particularly open to suspicion of being biased towards predominantly
   reporting climate change-induced impacts. No comprehensive study or
   meta-analysis has so far examined the possible lack of evidence for
   changes or shifts at sites where no temperature change is observed. We
   used an enormous systematic phenological network data set of more than
   125 000 observational series of 542 plant and 19 animal species in 21
   European countries (1971-2000). Our results showed that 78\% of all
   leafing, flowering and fruiting records advanced (30\% significantly)
   and only 3\% were significantly delayed, whereas the signal of leaf
   colouring/fall is ambiguous. We conclude that previously published
   results of phenological changes were not biased by reporting or
   publication predisposition: the average advance of spring/summer was 2.5
   days decade(-1) in Europe. Our analysis of 254 mean national time series
   undoubtedly demonstrates that species' phenology is responsive to
   temperature of the preceding months (mean advance of spring/summer by
   2.5 days degrees C(-1), delay of leaf colouring and fall by 1.0 day
   degrees C(-1)). The pattern of observed change in spring efficiently
   matches measured national warming across 19 European countries
   (correlation coefficient r=-0.69, P < 0.001).}},

	Abstract = {Chilling requirements of catkins, female inflorescences, and vegetative buds of 45 genotypes of Corylus avellana L. and 13 genotypes of other Corylus species and interspecific hybrids were estimated by cutting shoots in the field at weekly intervals and forcing them in a warm greenhouse for 4 weeks. Chilling requirements were lowest for catkins and highest for leaf buds, and ranged from less than 100 to 860 h for catkins, 290--1550 h for female flowers, and 365--1690 h for leaf buds. The lowest chilling requirements were observed for the leading C. avellana cultivars of Turkey and southern Italy. The yellow-leafed ornamental C. avellana cultivar `Aurea'had very high chilling requirements for all plant parts. Chilling requirements of vegetative buds of clones heterozygous for the non-dormant trait were less than those of clones homozygous for the dormant allele. Chilling requirements were comparable or slightly higher for three groups of other Corylus species, but were considerably higher for all plant parts of Corylus cornuta var. californica. Time of catkin elongation, stigma exsertion, and leaf bud swell in the field were highly and positively correlated with estimated chilling requirements of these plant parts. The chilling requirements of female inflorescences and vegetative buds were highly correlated. Genotypes with the same estimated chilling requirement leafed out as much as 3 weeks apart in the field, indicating differences in post-rest heat requirements.},

The experiment was carried out from Nov. 2006 and 2007 to Mar. 2007 and 2008. One-year-old twigs were prepared from four cultivars and four domestic genotypes of L. After leaf fall, the twigs were taken and placed in plastic bags and kept at 4 $\pm$1 $\,^{\circ}$C to stimulate 400 to 1500 chilling hours. After chilling, the excised twigs were transferred to the greenhouse with a natural photoperiod and a temperature from 18 to 27 $\,^{\circ}$C. The evaluation of budbreak was made three times a week and the number of accumulated growing degree hours ($\,^{\circ}$C) was determined until the buds reached the balloon or green tip stage. The chilling requirements were lowest (400 h) for catkins and highest (1000 h) for lateral buds. The Serr cultivar and `Z 'genotype had the lowest chilling requirements (650 and 650 h). `Lara', `Z ', `Z ', `Pedro', and `Z 'showed intermediate chilling requirements with values of 900, 900, 800, 750, and 750 h, respectively. Finally, `Hartley'completed its dormancy after an accumulation of 1000 h, being the walnut cultivar with the highest chilling requirement in our study. As the final result, the cultivars and genotypes were classified into three groups based on their heat requirements: low requirement (`Z 'and `Serr'), medium requirement (`Z ', `Z ', `Lara', and `Pedro'), and high requirement (`Hartley'and `Z ').},

	N2 = {Climatic water availability is a major determinant of forest structure and composition, while drought events may severely impact forest dynamics. In recent decades, an increasing number of severe drought events has been reported in forests around the world. In the future, climate models project increasingly dry conditions in many temperate regions. Various tools have been applied to better understand the effects of drought on forests, such as dendrochronological analyses, climatic trend analyses and dynamic models. With these approaches, water availability is often summarized as a single scalar, termed a drought or aridity index. As droughts are complex phenomena, such indices are always associated with a loss of information. Many different such indices exist, and have been developed for various purposes. This review asks whether some of these indices are more suitable than others to quantify water availability in temperate forests. In a first step, the rationale and theoretical background of different drought indices are spelled out and compared among each other. Then, evaluations and intercomparisons of drought indices from the literature are reviewed. The implementation of drought indices in dynamic forest models is also discussed. Finally, two current research questions are identified: the role of dry air for physiological drought, and the suitability of various drought indices under climate change. It appears from this review that indices accounting for evaporative demand generally perform better than indices based on precipitation alone. When comparing sites with different edaphic conditions, indices accounting for soil moisture storage are more suitable. Nevertheless, results from intercomparisons show considerable divergence, and it is not possible to clearly favor one index. Furthermore, a differential response of tree species to different drought indices is often observed, although no clear pattern emerges from this comparison. More intercomparisons of indices, across climates and species, might provide valuable knowledge. Another key finding is that the properties of indices also depend on choices regarding, e.g., the calculation of evaporative demand, or the underlying water balance model. Reporting such methodological details could greatly increase the value of future evaluations of drought indices.},

	N2 = {Abstract Many temperate herbs now flower earlier than a few decades ago. Little is known about other phenological events, despite the importance of life history integration for plant fitness. This study addresses the hypothesis that temporal shifts of multiple phenological events in herbs are concordant with temporal changes in weather. Explicitly showing that changes in timing of annual life cycle events are correlated with changes in weather-predicting variables provides support for the hypothesis that a phenological shift is concordant with climate change. Observations of six phenological events and five phenophases were made year-round for 25 yr for herb species in a deciduous forest fragment, Trelease Woods in Illinois, USA. Dates for 43 species were analyzed by linear mixed-effects models for events and phenophases and were compared to weather data from a nearby station. For early species, emergence was delayed by 1.5 d/decade, while end expansion advanced by 3.8 d/decade and begin dormancy advanced by 2.5 d/decade. For late species, end expansion advanced by 6.7 d/decade, while begin senescence delayed by 17.7 d/decade. Begin flowering and end flowering advanced similarly for both seasonal groups, at 3.8 to 4.2 d/decade. Some events showed no temporal change. Species differed greatly in the degree or direction of change, related to seasonality of event or length of phase. Overall, for a given species, most events are advancing (68.4{\%}) and most durations are shortening (74.4{\%}). In 12 of 13 cases, inter-annual variation in event date was predicted by a temperature-event?season combination variable, but in only six cases did both event date shift and weather variable warm through time. This finding supports the hypothesis that climate change is associated with changes in some, but not all, phenological events. This first long-term, multi-phase study of a community of temperate herb species indicates little temporal coherence of responses of multiple phases. Changes in date are event specific, phase specific, and species specific. This complexity of responses among species and uneven responses within a species? integrated annual cycle events has implications for evolutionary responses and more immediate interactions among plant, animal, and microbe species in this community.},

	Abstract = {Stem cuttings were obtained from 12 peach and nectarine cultivars during leaf fall, placed in plastic bags at 3.0$\pm$0.1$\,^{\circ}$C to simulate 0--800h of chilling and forced to budbreak at 20.0$\pm$1.0$\,^{\circ}$C for a period of 6 weeks. Some cultivars showed high blooming and leafing without exposure to chilling; chilling enhances leafing and blooming but the percentage increment was higher in leaf buds. In general, maximum budbreak was reached with less chilling accumulation (<100--200h) in flower buds compared with leaf buds; excessive chilling caused a reduction of the percentage budbreak in flower but not in leaf buds. Additionally, chilling modified the proportion of blooming that occurred before leafing. In non-chilled shoots, blooming occurred earlier than leafing, except in cv. `San Pedro 16--33'but the proportion of blooming before leafing decreased significantly with chilling in most cases. By studying the mean time to budbreak, we conclude that the flower bud generally has a lower intensity of rest; the intensity of rest declines at a slower rate in flower than in leaf buds with chilling; flower buds had greater heat requirements than leaf buds when the chilling requirement had been covered, so that each peach cultivar had a point of critical chilling accumulation below which blooming tended to occur earlier, and above which leafing tends to occur first. Flower and leaf buds had different depths of endodormancy but similar chilling requirements in the majority of peach and nectarine cultivars studied. Finally, different varieties with similar chilling requirements showed different responses to chilling. Therefore, the cutting test measuring the response of vegetative and floral buds provides considerable information on the characterisation of the variety, compared with the sole and traditional data of chilling requirements.},

	N2 = {Abstract Anthropogenic climate change is widely expected to drive species extinct by hampering individual survival and reproduction, by reducing the amount and accessibility of suitable habitat, or by eliminating other organisms that are essential to the species in question. Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17?50{\%} of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},

	Abstract = {The mutualism between plants and their pollinators provides globally important ecosystem services, but it is likely to be disrupted by global warming that can cause mismatches between both halves of this interaction. In this review, we summarise the available evidence on (i) spatial or (ii) phenological shifts of one or both of the actors of this mutualism. While the occurrence of future spatial mismatches is predominantly theoretical and based on predictive models, there is growing empirical evidence of phenological mismatches occurring at the present day. Mismatches may also occur when pollinators and their host plants are still found together. These mismatches can arise due to (iii) morphological modifications and (iv) disruptions to host attraction and foraging behaviours, and it is expected that these mismatches will lead to novel community assemblages. Overall plant--pollinator interactions seem to be resilient biological networks, particularly because generalist species can buffer these changes due to their plastic behaviour. However, we currently lack information on where and why spatial mismatches do occur and how they impact the fitness of plants and pollinators, in order to fully assess if adaptive evolutionary changes can keep pace with global warming predictions.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}Climatic warming is associated with organisms breeding carlier in the season than is typical for their species. In some species, however, response to warming is more complex than a simple advance in the timing of all life history events preceding reproduction. Disparities in the extent to which different components of the reproductive phenology of organisms very with climatic warming indicate that not all life history events are equally responsive to environmental variation. Here, we propose that out understanding of phenological response to climate change can be improved by considering entire sequences of events comprising the aggregate life histories of organisms preceding reproduction. We present results of a two-year warming experiment conducted on 33 individuals of three plant species inhabiting a low-arctic site. Analysis of phenological sequences of three key events for each species revealed how the aggregate life histories preceding reproduction responded to warming, and which individual events exerted the greatest influence on aggregate life history variation. For alpine chickweed (Cerastium alpinum), warming elicited a shortening of the duration of the emergence state by 2.5 days on average, but the aggregate life history did not differ between warmed and ambient plots. For gray willow (Salix glauca), however, all phenological events monitored occurred earlier on warmed than on ambient plots, and warming reduced the aggregate life history of this species by 22 days on average. Similarly, in dwarf birch (Betula nana), warming advanced flower bud set, blooming, and fruit set and reduced the aggregate life history by 27 days on average. Our approach provides important insight into life history responses of many organisms to climate change and other forms of environmental variation. Such insight may be compromised by considering changes in individual phenological events in isolation.{$]$}},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

	Abstract = {While climate warming reduces the occurrence of frost events, the warming-induced lengthening of the growing season of plants in the Northern Hemisphere may actually induce more frequent frost days during the growing season (GSFDs, days with minimum temperature < 0 $\,^{\circ}$C). Direct evidence of this hypothesis, however, is limited. Here we investigate the change in the number of GSFDs at latitudes greater than 30$\,^{\circ}$N using remotely-sensed and in situ phenological records and three minimum temperature (Tmin) data sets from 1982 to 2012. While decreased GSFDs are found in northern Siberia, the Tibetan Plateau, and northwestern North America (mainly in autumn), \~{}43{\%} of the hemisphere, especially in Europe, experienced a significant increase in GSFDs between 1982 and 2012 (mainly during spring). Overall, regions with larger increases in growing season length exhibit larger increases in GSFDs. Climate warming thus reduces the total number of frost days per year, but GSFDs nonetheless increase in many areas.},

As a result, information on phylogenetic relationships has underappreciated potential to inform ecological niche modeling. Here we review three strategies for incorporating evolutionary information into niche models: splitting lineages into subunits, lumping across lineages, and partial pooling of lineages into a common statistical framework that implicitly or explicitly accounts for evolutionary relationships. We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation. Progress in the field requires reexamination of how we assess models of niches versus models of distributions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

	N2 = {Abstract It has been predicted that environmental changes will radically alter the selective pressures on phenological traits. Long-lived species, such as trees, will be particularly affected, as they may need to undergo major adaptive change over only one or a few generations. The traits describing the annual life cycle of trees are generally highly evolvable, but nothing is known about the strength of their genetic correlations. Tight correlations can impose strong evolutionary constraints, potentially hampering the adaptation of multivariate phenological phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary, genetic and environmental components of the timing of leaf unfolding and senescence within an oak metapopulation along an elevation gradient. Population divergence, estimated from in situ and common-garden data, was compared to expectations under neutral evolution, based on microsatellite markers. This approach made it possible (1) to evaluate the influence of genetic correlation on multivariate local adaptation to elevation and (2) to identify traits probably exposed to past selective pressures due to the colder climate at high elevation. The genetic correlation was positive but very weak, indicating that genetic constraints did not shape the local adaptation pattern for leaf phenology. Both spring and fall (leaf unfolding and senescence, respectively) phenology timings were involved in local adaptation, but leaf unfolding was probably the trait most exposed to climate change-induced selection. Our data indicated that genetic variation makes a much smaller contribution to adaptation than the considerable plastic variation displayed by a tree during its lifetime. The evolutionary potential of leaf phenology is, therefore, probably not the most critical aspect for short-term population survival in a changing climate.},

We used seedlings from three populations of each species inhabiting different altitudes (400, 800 and 1200?m asl.). Leaf unfolding in spring and leaf senescence in autumn were monitored on seedlings for 2?years. 3.?Overall, a high phenological plasticity was found for both species. The reaction norms of leaf unfolding date to temperature linearly accelerated for both species with an average shift of ?5·7?days per degree increase. Timing of leaf senescence exhibited hyperbolic trends for beech due to earlier senescence at the lowest elevation garden and no or slight trends for oak. There was no difference in the magnitude of phenological plasticity among populations from different elevations. For both species, the growing season length increased to reach maximum values at about 10?13?$\,^{\circ}$C of annual temperature according to the population. 4.?Since the magnitude of phenological plasticity is high for all the tested populations, they are likely to respond immediately to temperature variations in terms of leaf phenology. Consequently the mid- to high-elevation populations are likely to experience a longer growing season with climate warming. The results suggest that climate warming could lengthen the growing season of all populations over the altitudinal gradient, although the low-elevation populations, especially of beech, may experience accelerated senescence and shorter growing season due to drought and other climate changes associated with warming.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}The commonly observed proximal-to-distal decrease within inflorescences of fruit and/or seed maturation per flower has frequently been attributed to competition among developing fruits for resources. The research summarized in this review suggests, however, that the observed variation can also be due to architecture--that is, to sources of variation inherent in plant axes. Thus, the fate of a developing flower depends not only on the reproductive events that have preceded it during the ontogeny of the organism, but on where it occurs within the architecture of an individual. The effects of architecture are separable experimentally from the effects of differential resource allocation, and careful experimental analysis of these two factors will enhance our understanding of the physiological, developmental, and evolutionary controls of fruit and seed production in flowering plants.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Organisms'life cycles consist of hierarchical stages, from a single phenological stage (for example, flowering within a season), to vegetative and reproductive phases, to the total lifespan of the individual. Yet phenological events are typically studied in isolation, limiting our understanding of life history responses to climate change. Here, we reciprocally transfer plant communities along an elevation gradient to investigate plastic changes in the duration of sequential phenological events for six alpine species. We show that prolonged flowering leads to longer reproductive phases and activity periods when plants are moved to warmer locations. In contrast, shorter post-fruiting leaf and flowering stages led to shorter vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively, which resulted in shorter activity periods when plants were moved to cooler conditions. Therefore, phenological responses to warming and cooling do not simply mirror one another in the opposite direction, and low temperature may limit reproductive allocation in the alpine region.},

	Abstract = {Water stress is known to cause xylem cavitation in the leaves, roots and stems of plants, but little is known about the vulnerability of flowers to xylem damage during drought. This is an important gap in our understanding of how and when plants become damaged by water stress. Here we address fundamental questions about if and when flowers suffer cavitation damage, using a new technique of cavitation imaging to resolve the timing of cavitation in water-stressed flower petals compared with neighbouring leaves. Leaves and flowers from a sample of two herbaceous and two woody eudicots were exposed to a severe water stress while the spatial and temporal propagation of embolism through veins was recorded. Although in most cases water potentials inducing 50% embolism of herbaceous flower veins were more negative than neighbouring leaves, there was no significant difference between the average vulnerability of leaves and petals of herbaceous species. In both woody species, petals were more vulnerable to cavitation than leaves, in one case by more than 3 MPa. Early cavitation and subsequent damage of flowers in the two woody species would thus be expected to precede leaf damage during drought. Similar cavitation thresholds of flowers and leaves in the herb sample suggest that cavitation during water shortage in these species will occur simultaneously among aerial tissues. Species-specific differences in the cavitation thresholds of petals provide a new axis of variation that may explain contrasting flowering ecology among plant species.},

	N2 = {Summary Many perennial plants display masting, that is, fruiting with strong interannual variations, irregular and synchronized between trees within the population. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the early flower phenology in temperate oak species promotes stochasticity into their fruiting dynamics, which could play a major role in tree reproductive success. From a large field monitoring network, we compared the pollen phenology between temperate and Mediterranean oak species. Then, focusing on temperate oak species, we explored the influence of the weather around the time of budburst and flowering on seed production, and simulated with a mechanistic model the consequences that an evolutionary shifting of flower phenology would have on fruiting dynamics. Temperate oak species release pollen earlier in the season than do Mediterranean oak species. Such early flowering in temperate oak species results in pollen often being released during unfavorable weather conditions and frequently results in reproductive failure. If pollen release were delayed as a result of natural selection, fruiting dynamics would exhibit much reduced stochastic variation. We propose that early flower phenology might be adaptive by making mast-seeding years rare and unpredictable, which would greatly help in controlling the dynamics of seed consumers.},

	Abstract = {Leaf phenology is a major driver of ecosystem functioning in temperate forests and a robust indicator of climate change. Both the inter-annual and inter-population variability of leaf phenology have received much attention in the literature; in contrast, the within-population variability of leaf phenology has been far less studied. Beyond its impact on individual tree physiological processes, the within-population variability of leaf phenology can affect the estimation of the average budburst or leaf senescence dates at the population scale. Here, we monitored the progress of spring and autumn leaf phenology over 14 tree populations (9 tree species) in six European forests over the period of 2011 to 2018 (yielding 16 site-years of data for spring, 14 for autumn). We monitored 27 to 512 (with a median of 62) individuals per population. We quantified the within-population variability of leaf phenology as the standard deviation of the distribution of individual dates of budburst or leaf senescence (SDBBi and SDLSi, respectively). Given the natural variability of phenological dates occurring in our tree populations, we estimated from the data that a minimum sample size of 28 (resp. 23) individuals, are required to estimate SDBBi (resp. SDLSi) with a precision of 3 (resp. 7) days. The within-population of leaf senescence (average SDLSi = 8.5 days) was on average two times larger than for budburst (average SDBBi = 4.0 days). We evidenced that warmer temperature during the budburst period and a late average budburst date were associated with a lower SDBBi, as a result of a quicker spread of budburst in tree populations, with a strong species effect. Regarding autumn phenology, we observed that later senescence and warm temperatures during the senescence period were linked with a high SDLSi, with a strong species effect. The shares of variance explained by our models were modest suggesting that other factors likely influence the within-population variation in leaf phenology. For instance, a detailed analysis revealed that summer temperatures were negatively correlated with a lower SDLSi.},

Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting (πtlp), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of πtlp and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that πtlp was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both πtlp and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWCtlp) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor (πo) and bulk modulus of elasticity (ε). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that πo is the major driver of πtlp. In contrast, εplays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWCtlp, preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

	Abstract = {The supra-annual mast fruiting of dipterocarps, dominant trees of Far Eastern lowland rain forests, has been considered an adaptation to reduce seed predation through satiation. However, this explanation raises four important questions. (1) What pollinates species that flower at intervals of more than one year? (2) How do mass-flowering species avoid competition for pollinators? (3) What is the environmental cue for floral induction that induces scores of species in several families to flower at irregular intervals of more than one year in an aseasonal climate? (4) And, most important, what factors could cause an initial phenological aggregation of species' fruiting times? Once such a phenological core of species exists, selection for predator satiation could entrain other species into the same fruiting schedule and perfect the synchrony of seed release. The essential question is how such a phenological core of species, flowering at irregular intervals in an aseasonal climate, could initially arise. The observations and analyses presented here indicate that the answers to these questions are intricately related to each other and to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. (1) Several mass-flowering dipterocarps are pollinated by thrips, which persist at low levels between mass flowerings and can explode in density as the dipterocarps come into flower. (2) Mass-flowering dipterocarp species in Shorea section Mutica significantly reduce the overlap in flowering times by staggering their flowering periods, thereby reducing competition for pollinators and/or the clogging of stigmas with foreign pollen. The new technique used to analyze whether a particular pattern of resource use significantly reduces overlap overcomes an error inherent in previous techniques, and it should be used whenever the total flowering season or range of resources is determined not by external conditions, but by the range of flowering times or resources used by the species in question. (3) The time of floral induction in Shorea section Mutica is derived using the linear relationship between the duration of each species' flowering period and mean flowering date. An analysis of meteorological records suggests that induction is caused by a drop of roughly 2{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ{\$}C or more in minimum nighttime temperature for three or more nights. This extraordinary trigger is probably the most reliable signal associated with an invasion of the aseasonal tropics by a dry air mass. (4) Such a trigger does not appear to be directly adaptive in the aseasonal tropics, but in the seasonal tropics it would result in flowering at the onset of dry season and ripening fruits at the beginning of rainy season. This suggests that the Dipterocarpaceae may have arisen initially in the seasonal tropics, even though their center of species diversity is now in the aseasonal tropics. Invasion of the aseasonal tropics by trees having such a floral trigger, adapted to the seasonal tropics, could help explain the origin of a phenological core of species flowering and fruiting more or less synchronously at intervals of several years. The droughts causing these mass flowerings may, in some cases, be driven by the climatic effects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the western Pacific, as evidenced by the temporal association of El Nino years with drought and mast fruiting on windward slopes of tropical Malesia.},

	N2 = {Abstract Our understanding of the factors that shape reproductive phenology in Southeast Asian tropical forests comes almost exclusively from studies of everwet, general flowering (GF) forests. Therefore, we examined the phenology of an evergreen dipterocarp forest in a climate exhibiting seasonal drought in Southeast Asia, with the aim of evaluating what evidence it brings to bear on the hypothesis that reproductive phenology in contemporary dipterocarp forests is the product of evolutionarily conserved responses to seasonal drought. We hypothesized that (1) dipterocarp forests that experience seasonal drought would exhibit annual reproduction and seasonality similar to that of forests with similar climates in other parts of the world, (2) within species, flowering frequency would be climate-dependent, not a fixed trait, and (3) climatic events that cue flowering in everwet forests would also cue flowering in seasonally dry forests. From 2001 to 2009, we monitored flowering and fruiting monthly for 1,344 trees (>300 spp.) in a forest in Khao Chong (KC), Thailand that experiences an annual 2?4 month dry season, assessing frequency, duration, seasonality and synchrony of reproduction. We also examined phenological records for trees in three dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet climates. Reproductive phenology of the KC forest was more similar to tropical forests with similar rainfall seasonality in other parts of the world than it was to dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet regions of Southeast Asia. The forest exhibited annual reproduction, with peak flowering occurring at the end of the dry season and peak fruiting occurring early in the wet season. Approximately half of all species and individuals reproduced annually, including several species that are known to exhibit ?general flowering? in everwet climates. Short dry spells appeared to cue flowering for early flowering species, while later flowering species may have responded to either low precipitation or temperature, consistent with data from everwet forests. GF behaviour also showed significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the phenological behaviour of both seasonal and everwet dipterocarp forests may have initially evolved in response to seasonal drought and that the general flowering phenomenon is a product of evolutionary conservatism.},

@article{Revell2008,
	Abstract = {A recent advance in the phylogenetic comparative analysis of continuous traits has been explicit, model-based measurement of ``phylogenetic signal''in data sets composed of observations collected from species related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal (due to the resulting high resemblance between related species). In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift, there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal. For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex. For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary process or rate based on estimates of phylogenetic signal.},

@article{Savage2013,
	Abstract = {{$[$}With increasing concern about the ecological consequences of global climate change, there has been renewed interest in understanding the processes that determine species range limits. We tested a long-hypothesized trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate that is often used to explain species range limits. We grew 24 willow and poplar species (family Salicaceae) collected from across North America in a greenhouse common garden under two climate treatments. Maximum entropy models were used to describe species distributions and to estimate species-specific climate parameters. A range of traits related to freezing tolerance, including senescence, budburst, and susceptibility to different temperature minima during and after acclimation were measured. As predicted, species from colder climates exhibited higher freezing tolerance and slower growth rates than species from warmer climates under certain environmental conditions. However, the average relative growth rate (millimeters per meter per day) of northern species markedly increased when a subset of species was grown under a long summer day length (20.5 h), indicating that genetically based day-length cues are required for growth regulation in these species. We conclude that the observed relationship between freezing tolerance and growth rate is not driven by differences in species' intrinsic growth capacity but by differences in the environmental cues that trigger growth. We propose that the coordinated evolution of freezing tolerance and growth phenology could be important in circumscribing willow and poplar range limits and may have important implications for species' current and future distributions.{$]$}},

	N2 = {ABSTRACT Aim? To analyse the global patterns in species richness of Viperidae snakes through the deconstruction of richness into sets of species according to their distribution models, range size, body size and phylogenetic structure, and to test if environmental drivers explaining the geographical ranges of species are similar to those explaining richness patterns, something we called the extreme deconstruction principle. Location? Global. Methods? We generated a global dataset of 228 terrestrial viperid snakes, which included geographical ranges (mapped at 1$\,^{\circ}$resolution, for a grid with 7331 cells world-wide), body sizes and phylogenetic relationships among species. We used logistic regression (generalized linear model; GLM) to model species geographical ranges with five environmental predictors. Sets of species richness were also generated for large and small-bodied species, for basal and derived species and for four classes of geographical range sizes. Richness patterns were also modelled against the five environmental variables through standard ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regressions. These subsets are replications to test if environmental factors driving species geographical ranges can be directly associated with those explaining richness patterns. Results? Around 48{\%} of the total variance in viperid richness was explained by the environmental model, but richness sets revealed different patterns across the world. The similarity between OLS coefficients and the primacy of variables across species geographical range GLMs was equal to 0.645 when analysing all viperid snakes. Thus, in general, when an environmental predictor it is important to model species geographical ranges, this predictor is also important when modelling richness, so that the extreme deconstruction principle holds. However, replicating this correlation using subsets of species within different categories in body size, range size and phylogenetic structure gave more variable results, with correlations between GLM and OLS coefficients varying from ?0.46 up to 0.83. Despite this, there is a relatively high correspondence (r = 0.73) between the similarity of GLM-OLS coefficients and R2 values of richness models, indicating that when richness is well explained by the environment, the relative importance of environmental drivers is similar in the richness OLS and its corresponding set of GLMs. Main conclusions? The deconstruction of species richness based on macroecological traits revealed that, at least for range size and phylogenetic level, the causes underlying patterns in viperid richness differ for the various sets of species. On the other hand, our analyses of extreme deconstruction using GLM for species geographical range support the idea that, if environmental drivers determine the geographical distribution of species by establishing niche boundaries, it is expected, at least in theory, that the overlap among ranges (i.e. richness) will reveal similar effects of these environmental drivers. Richness patterns may be indeed viewed as macroecological consequences of population-level processes acting on species geographical ranges.},

	N2 = {Shifts in the timing of species interactions are often cited as a consequence of climate change and, if present, are expected to have wide-reaching implications for ecological communities. Our knowledge about these shifts mostly comes from single systems, which have provided no clear picture, thus limiting our understanding of how species interactions may be responding overall. Using a new global database based on long-term data on the seasonal timing of biological events for pairwise species interactions, we find that the relative timing of interacting species has changed substantially in recent decades. The observed shifts are greater in magnitude than before recent climate change began, suggesting that there will be widespread warming-related shifts in the synchrony of species in the future.Phenological responses to climate change (e.g., earlier leaf-out or egg hatch date) are now well documented and clearly linked to rising temperatures in recent decades. Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent {$[$}Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902{$]$} or relatively uncommon {$[$}Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348--2359{$]$}, suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator--prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}The strength of phylogenetic signal in extinction risk can give insight into the mechanisms behind species' declines. Nevertheless, no existing measure of phylogenetic pattern in a binary trait, such as extinctionrisk status, measures signal strength in a way that can be compared among data sets. We developed a new measure f or phylogenetic signal of binary traits, D, which simulations show gives robust results with data sets of more than 50 species, even when the proportion of threatened species is low. We applied D to the red-list status of British birds and the world's mammals and found that the threat status for both groups exhibited moderately strong phylogenetic clumping. We also tested the hypothesis that the phylogenetic pattern of species threatened by harvesting will be more strongly clumped than for those species threatened by either habitat loss or invasive species because the life-history traits mediating the effects of harvesting show strong evolutionary pattern. For mammals, our results supported our hypothesis; there was significant but weaker phylogenetic signal in the risk caused by the other two drivers (habitat loss and invasive species). We conclude that D is likely to be a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic pattern in many binary traits. La intensidad de la se{\~n}al filogen{\`e}tica en el riesgo de extinci{\'o}n puede proporcionar perspectivas acerca de los mecanismos subyacentes en la declinaci{\'o}n de las especies. Sin embargo, ninguna medida existente del patr{\'o}n filogen{\`e}tico en un atributo binario, como el estatus de riesgo de extinci{\'o}n, cuantifica la intensidad de la se{\~n}al de modo que pueda ser comparada entre conjuntos de datos. Desarrollamos una nueva medida de la se{\~n}al filogen{\`e}tica para atributos binarios, D, que en simulaciones proporciona resultados robustos con conjuntos de datos de m{\'a}s de 50 especies, aun cuando la proporci{\'o}n de especies amenazadas sea baja.

	N2 = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ?trait? itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ?performance paradigm? to plant ecology. ?Functional traits? are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ?integration functions? which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

Phenological research, however, is often limited by the temporal, geographic, or phylogenetic scope of available data. Hundreds of millions of plant specimens in herbaria worldwide offer a potential solution to this problem, especially as digitization efforts drastically improve access to collections. Herbarium specimens represent snapshots of phenological events and have been reliably used to characterize phenological responses to climate. We review the current state of herbarium-based phenological research, identify potential biases and limitations in the collection, digitization, and interpretation of specimen data, and discuss future opportunities for phenological investigations using herbarium specimens.},

Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.},

	N2 = {Abstract Measures of the seasonal timing of biological events are key to addressing questions about how phenology evolves, modifies species interactions, and mediates biological responses to climate change. Phenology is often characterized in terms of discrete events, such as a date of first flowering or arrival of first migrants. We discuss how phenological events that are typically measured at the population or species level arise from distributions of phenological events across seasons, and from norms of reaction of these phenological events across environments. We argue that individual variation in phenological distributions and reaction norms has important implications for how we should collect, analyze, and interpret phenological information. Regarding phenology as a reaction norm rather than one year's specific values implies that selection acts on the phenologies that an individual expresses over its lifetime. To understand how climate change is likely to influence phenology, we need to consider not only plastic responses along the reaction norm but changes in the reaction norm itself. We show that when individuals vary in their reaction norms, correlations between reaction norm elevation and slope make first events particularly poor estimators of population sensitivity to climate change, and variation in slopes can obscure the pattern of selection on phenology. We also show that knowing the shape of the distribution of phenological events across the season is important for predicting biologically important phenological mismatches with climate change. Last, because phenological events are parts of a continuous developmental process, we suggest that the approach of measuring phenology by recording developmental stages of individuals in a population at a single point in time should be used more widely. We conclude that failure to account for phenological distributions and reaction norms may lead to overinterpretation of metrics based on single events, such as commonly recorded first event dates, and may confound meta-analyses that use a range of metrics. Rather than prescribing a single universal approach to studying phenology, we point out limitations of inferences based on single metrics and encourage work that considers the multivariate nature of phenology and more tightly links data collection and analyses with biological hypotheses.},

   practices for Populus tomentosa plantations, the leaf phenology
   variation within the canopy and its relationship with transpiration of
   well-watered P. tomentosa tree in a dense plantation were investigated.
   The variation in canopy light interception, indicated by the ratio
   between net radiation under (Rn-u) and above (Rn-a) canopy, with leaf
   development was also studied. During the growing season, the achievement
   of maximum leaf number tended to be later in higher parts of the canopy.
   In the lower and middle canopy, the leaf number maximized earlier in the
   east-facing side than in the west-facing side, but this difference
   disappeared in the upper canopy. The Rn-u/Rn-a was stable in May, but
   declined and then varied steadily until late August. Generally, in May,
   the crop coefficient (K-cb) of the tree reached its highest level and
   was not correlated with leaf area (LA) in all layers (p > 0.05).
   However, it increased linearly (p < 0.001) with LA in the layers above a
   canopy height of 3 m from June to late August, and most of its variation
   was explained by LA in the 5-7 m layer. After late August, K-cb
   decreased linearly with decreasing LA in all layers (p < 0.001).
   Consequently, a temporal ecological strategy seems to be adopted by P.
   tomentosa leaves in different layers and azimuthal sides for efficient
   light acquisition. The contribution of the different canopy layers to
   tree transpiration can vary, with the leaves in the upper and all layers
   mainly controlling transpiration in summer and in spring and autumn,

@article{Breda1996,
	Abstract = {{Bud-burst, leaf area index (LAI), transpiration, soil water content and
   radial growth of a 35-year-old Quercus petraea stand were measured
   during 5 successive years (1989-1993). At the beginning of 1992, half of
   the stand was thinned. The increase of stand transpiration during spring
   was linearly correlated to the development of LAI. During the second
   part of the season, although LAI continued to increase because of
   rhythmic shoot development, transpiration was strongly reduced as soil
   water content decreased. The transpiration/potential evapotranspiration
   (T/PET) ratio decreased sharply as soon as relative extractable water
   (REW) dropped below 0.4. Likewise, cumulated stand transpiration varied
   among years because of variability in soil water availability, LAI and
   canopy structure. A linear relationship, similar to the one observed for
   weekly variations, was noted between T/PET and LAI; maximum LAI ranged
   from 3.3 to 6 in this ring-porous species. Seasonal circumference
   measurements showed that 43\% of the annual increment was achieved
   before leaf development, hence before canopy transpiration and CO2
   assimilation were started. Tree ring area was significantly correlated
   to the cumulated transpiration; a water-use efficiency variable was
   defined at both tree and stand level.}},

@article{MunguiaRosas2011,
	Abstract = {{P>Flowering times of plants are important life-history components and it
   has previously been hypothesized that flowering phenologies may be
   currently subject to natural selection or be selectively neutral. In
   this study we reviewed the evidence for phenotypic selection acting on
   flowering phenology using ordinary and phylogenetic meta-analysis.
   Phenotypic selection exists when a phenotypic trait co-varies with
   fitness; therefore, we looked for studies reporting an association
   between two components of flowering phenology (flowering time or
   flowering synchrony) with fitness. Data sets comprising 87 and 18 plant
   species were then used to assess the incidence and strength of
   phenotypic selection on flowering time and flowering synchrony,
   respectively. The influence of dependence on pollinators, the duration
   of the reproductive event, latitude and plant longevity as moderators of
   selection were also explored. Our results suggest that selection favours
   early flowering plants, but the strength of selection is influenced by
   latitude, with selection being stronger in temperate environments.
   However, there is no consistent pattern of selection on flowering
   synchrony. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic selection on flowering
   time is consistent and relatively strong, in contrast to previous
   hypotheses of selective neutrality, and has implications for the
   evolution of temperate floras under global climate change.}},

In contrast, after successive years of vegetative growth at early ages, woody perennial shoot meristems begin repeated transitions between vegetative and reproductive growth at sexual maturity. However, it is unknown how these repeated transitions occur without a developmental conflict between vegetative and reproductive growth. We report that functionally diverged paralogs FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (FT2), products of whole-genome duplication and homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), coordinate the repeated cycles of vegetative and reproductive growth in woody perennial poplar (Populus spp.). Our manipulative physiological and genetic experiments coupled with field studies, expression profiling, and network analysis reveal that reproductive onset is determined by FT1 in response to winter temperatures, whereas vegetative growth and inhibition of bud set are promoted by FT2 in response to warm temperatures and long days in the growing season. The basis for functional differentiation between FT1 and FT2 appears to be expression pattern shifts, changes in proteins, and divergence in gene regulatory networks. Thus, temporal separation of reproductive onset and vegetative growth into different seasons via FT1 and FT2 provides seasonality and demonstrates the evolution of a complex perennial adaptive trait after genome duplication.},

@article{Lamont2011,
	Abstract = {Data on 386 species with fire-stimulated flowering (fsf) in Australasia and South Africa/Madagascar were collated to show that they occur under a wide range of fire regimes, with 71{\%} confined to the mediterranean-climate regions. About 40{\%} only flower up to 2 years after fire (obligate), while the rest continue at a low rate until the next fire (facultative). Peak flowering occurs 5--18 months after fire in the mediterranean regions but at 1--7 months in savannas. Fsf is recorded in 34 families, headed by terrestrial orchids (45{\%} of species), spread throughout the seed-plant phylogeny from cycads to daisies. Tuberous geophytes (essentially orchids) dominate (51{\%}), but other resprouting growth forms include lignotuberous shrubs and forbs, rhizomatous and bunch grasses, leaf succulents, grasstrees, epicormic trees, and hemiparasites. Most have wind-dispersed diaspores (72{\%}), store their diaspores in the soil (93{\%}), and seeds that do not germinate until the next fire (72{\%}). Fsf in association with resprouting takes advantage of optimal resources and minimal competition for growth and reproduction, conditions that favor wind dispersal and maximize the interval for seed accumulation before the next fire and build-up of fire-tolerant organs. Reduced herbivory has little role in accounting for its benefits. The proximal causes of fsf center around cueing factors (direct effects such as ethylene), resource factors (direct and indirect effects, e.g., extra nutrients), and predisposing factors (circumstantial effects, e.g., fire interval). The evolutionary history of fsf has been explored recently in orchids, proteas, blood roots, droseras, and mistletoes and shown to stretch back over a period of at least 50 million years, indicating that flowering in many groups has a long association with fire as an agent of natural selection.},

	N2 = {BackgroundThe rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 {\%} of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.Scope and ConclusionsWind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

	Abstract = {We are now reaching the stage at which specific genetic factors with known physiological effects can be tied directly and quantitatively to variation in phenology. With such a mechanistic understanding, scientists can better predict phenological responses to novel seasonal climates. Using the widespread model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we explore how variation in different genetic pathways can be linked to phenology and life-history variation across geographical regions and seasons. We show that the expression of phenological traits including flowering depends critically on the growth season, and we outline an integrated life-history approach to phenology in which the timing of later life-history events can be contingent on the environmental cues regulating earlier life stages. As flowering time in many plants is determined by the integration of multiple environmentally sensitive gene pathways, the novel combinations of important seasonal cues in projected future climates will alter how phenology responds to variation in the flowering time gene network with important consequences for plant life history. We discuss how phenology models in other systems--both natural and agricultural--could employ a similar framework to explore the potential contribution of genetic variation to the physiological integration of cues determining phenology.},

	N2 = {Summary Accurate predictions of spring plant phenology with climate change are critical for projections of growing seasons, plant communities and a number of ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology ? temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod ? generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst (?15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout (?19.1 and ?11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

@article{Piao2007,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},

When exploring correlations between species traits, therefore, species cannot be treated as statistically independent. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) attempt to correct statistically for this shared evolutionary history. Almost all such approaches, however, assume that correlations between traits are constant across the tips of the tree, which we refer to as phylogenetic stationarity. We suggest that this assumption of phylogenetic stationarity might be often violated and that relationships between species traits might evolve alongside clades, for example, owing to the effects of unmeasured traits or other latent variables. Specific examples range from shifts in allometric scaling relationships between clades (e.g., basal metabolic rate and body mass in endotherms, and tree diameter and biomass in trees) to the differing relationship between leaf mass per area and shade tolerance in deciduous versus evergreen trees and shrubs. Innovation Here, we introduce an exploratory modelling framework, phylogenetically weighted regression, which represents an extension of geographically weighted regression (GWR) used in spatial studies, to allow non-stationarity in model parameters across a phylogenetic tree. We demonstrate our approach using empirical data on flowering time and seed mass from a well-studied plant community in southeastern Sweden. Our model reveals strong, diverging trends across the phylogeny, including changes in the sign of the relationship between clades. Main conclusions By allowing for phylogenetic non-stationarity, we are able to detect shifting relationships among species traits that would be obscured in traditional PCMs; thus, we suggest that PWR might be an important exploratory tool in the search for key missing variables in comparative analyses.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Biotic pollination is thought to correlate with increased interspecific competition for pollination among plants and a higher speciation rate. In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.},

	Abstract = {A number of morphologic features have evolved in evolutionarily divergent plant groups that appear to increase the efficiency of wind pollination. Among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains, female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles, and population structures with a high density of con-specifics. This paper reviews the aerodynamic theory, and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs. The efficiency of wind pollination is shown to be dictated principally by the vectoral properties of air currents created by and around ovulate organs and the physical properties of pollen that dictate their behavior as airborne particles. /// Eine Anzahl von morphologischen Kennzeichen, die Effizienz der Windpollination zu steigern scheinen, haben sich in evolution\&{\#}xe4;r ausenandergehonden Pflanzengruppen entwickelt.

	Abstract = {{Premise of the Study New growth in the spring requires resource
   mobilization in the vascular system at a time when xylem and phloem
   function are often reduced in seasonally cold climates. As a result, the
   timing of leaf out and/or flowering could depend on when the vascular
   system resumes normal function in the spring. This study investigated
   whether flowering time is influenced by vascular phenology in plants
   that flower precociously before they have leaves. Methods Flower, leaf,
   and vascular phenology were monitored in pairs of precocious and
   non-precocious congeners. Differences in resource allocation were
   quantified by measuring bud dry mass and water content throughout the
   year, floral hydration was modelled, and a girdling treatment completed
   on branches in the field. Key Results Precocious flowering species
   invested more in floral buds the year before flowering than did their
   non-precocious congeners, thus mobilizing less water in the spring,
   which allowed flowering before new vessel maturation. Conclusions A
   shift in the timing of resource allocation in precocious flowering
   plants allowed them to flower before the production of mature vessels
   and minimized the significance of seasonal changes in vascular function
   to their flowering phenology. The low investment required to complete
   floral development in the spring when the plant vascular system is often
   compromised could explain why flowers can emerge before leaf out.}},

	Abstract = {{Today, angiosperms are fundamental players in the diversity and
   biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Yet despite the omnipresence
   of angiosperms in today's ecosystems, the basic evolutionary
   understanding of how the earliest angiosperms functioned remains
   unknown. Here we synthesize ecophysiological, paleobotanical,
   paleoecological, and phylogenetic lines of evidence about early
   angiosperms and their environments. In doing so, we arrive at a
   hypothesis that early angiosperms evolved in evermoist tropical
   terrestrial habitats, where three of their emblematic innovations -
   including net-veined leaves, xylem vessels, and flowers - found
   ecophysiological advantages. However, the adaptation of early angiosperm
   ecophysiology to wet habitats did not initially promote massive
   diversification and ecological dominance. Instead, wet habitats were
   permissive for the ecological roothold of the clade, a critical phase of
   early diversification that entailed experimentation with a range of
   functional innovations in the leaves, wood, and flowers. Later, our
   results suggest that some of these innovations were co-opted gradually
   for new roles in the evolution of greater productivity and drought
   tolerance, which are characteristics seen across the vast majority of
   derived and ecologically dominant angiosperms today.}},

@article{Milleron2012,
	Abstract = {{The effect of non-reproductive trees and saplings as a physical barrier
   to pollen dispersal in wind-pollinated species' forests has not received
   enough attention in the literature so far. The neighborhood seedling
   model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different
   stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as
   a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological
   overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind
   directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a
   mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The
   ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by
   seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species
   (Quercus petraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last,
   to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first
   plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for
   recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting
   the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to
   pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination
   directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic
   winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech
   pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed,
   enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen
   dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of
   canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf
   phenology of co-occurring species in the forest.}},

@article{Nathan2005,
	Abstract = {{Seed terminal velocity and release height are recognized as key biotic
   determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet,
   potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics
   in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received
   much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and
   experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how
   seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by leaf-area index
   (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model,
   previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also
   reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics for a
   wide range of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more
   organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to
   higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are
   also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that
   former effect more than compensates for the latter, i.e., conditions of
   low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many
   temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring
   or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals
   that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD
   of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed terminal velocity.
   Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for
   distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its
   results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density
   dynamics.}},

@article{Whitehead1969,
	Abstract = {Studies of the aerodynamics of particle transport and capture suggest that the conditions most propitious for effective wind pollination are as follows: (1) production and release of large numbers of grains; (2) both anthers and stigma exposed; (3) grains falling within a certain size range (20-40\&{\#}x3bc;); very small grains will be dispersed readily but cannot be captured efficiently by the stigma, large grains have a high terminal velocity, hence will settle too rapidly; (4) exine of grains thin (or with large air spaces), sculpture smooth; (5) the stigma should present much surface area to capture grains, but, since collection efficiency will decrease with increasing stigma diameter, the increase in surface should be accomplished through the evolution of a complex stigma with many branches of small diameter; (6) individuals of the species should not be too widely spaced in the vegetation; (7) the vegetation should be open in structure or deciduous; thus there will be few obstructions to transport during at least one portion of the year; (8) flowering must be closely coordinated by relatively unambiguous environmental stimuli; (9) pollen release (hence flowering) should coincide with the most favorable time of the year for transport (low probability of precipitation, adequate winds and turbulence, deciduous season). The geography of wind pollination in the angiosperms can be understood best in terms of these prerequisites for efficient transport of pollen. Anemophily is very infrequent in the tropical rain forest, becomes more frequent as one moves to more seasonally variable environments, and is frequent in northern temperate forests. The environment of the tropical rain forest is unsuitable for anemophily: (1) species diversity is very high, hence individuals of the same species are apt to be widely spaced; (2) the forest is densely structured, hence wind velocities are low and there are many obstacles to transport; (3) there is no leafless season; (4) rainfall is frequent throughout the year, hence transport will be limited; (5) there are few unambiguous stimuli which can coordinate flowering; (6) potential animal pollinators are abundant. These conditions do not exist in northern temperate forests, or in prairies, or in savannas. It is possible that the evolution of wind pollination in the angiosperms paralleled the evolution of the deciduous habit. Axelrod has suggested that the deciduous habit evolved in response to seasonal drought as angiosperms migrated into lower middle latitudes during the early Cretaceous. Both the deciduous habit and the physical conditions existing just peripheral to the tropics would favor the evolution of wind pollination. An examination of seasonal environments in the tropics at present and the fossil record of deciduous and wind pollinated angiosperms supports this contention.},
