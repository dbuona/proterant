	Abstract = {Ecological niches reflect not only adaptation to local circumstances but also the tendency of related lineages to share environmental tolerances. As a result, information on phylogenetic relationships has underappreciated potential to inform ecological niche modeling. Here we review three strategies for incorporating evolutionary information into niche models: splitting lineages into subunits, lumping across lineages, and partial pooling of lineages into a common statistical framework that implicitly or explicitly accounts for evolutionary relationships. We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation. Progress in the field requires reexamination of how we assess models of niches versus models of distributions.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.},

	N2 = {Abstract It has been predicted that environmental changes will radically alter the selective pressures on phenological traits. Long-lived species, such as trees, will be particularly affected, as they may need to undergo major adaptive change over only one or a few generations. The traits describing the annual life cycle of trees are generally highly evolvable, but nothing is known about the strength of their genetic correlations. Tight correlations can impose strong evolutionary constraints, potentially hampering the adaptation of multivariate phenological phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary, genetic and environmental components of the timing of leaf unfolding and senescence within an oak metapopulation along an elevation gradient. Population divergence, estimated from in situ and common-garden data, was compared to expectations under neutral evolution, based on microsatellite markers. This approach made it possible (1) to evaluate the influence of genetic correlation on multivariate local adaptation to elevation and (2) to identify traits probably exposed to past selective pressures due to the colder climate at high elevation. The genetic correlation was positive but very weak, indicating that genetic constraints did not shape the local adaptation pattern for leaf phenology. Both spring and fall (leaf unfolding and senescence, respectively) phenology timings were involved in local adaptation, but leaf unfolding was probably the trait most exposed to climate change-induced selection. Our data indicated that genetic variation makes a much smaller contribution to adaptation than the considerable plastic variation displayed by a tree during its lifetime. The evolutionary potential of leaf phenology is, therefore, probably not the most critical aspect for short-term population survival in a changing climate.},

We used seedlings from three populations of each species inhabiting different altitudes (400, 800 and 1200?m asl.). Leaf unfolding in spring and leaf senescence in autumn were monitored on seedlings for 2?years. 3.?Overall, a high phenological plasticity was found for both species. The reaction norms of leaf unfolding date to temperature linearly accelerated for both species with an average shift of ?5·7?days per degree increase. Timing of leaf senescence exhibited hyperbolic trends for beech due to earlier senescence at the lowest elevation garden and no or slight trends for oak. There was no difference in the magnitude of phenological plasticity among populations from different elevations. For both species, the growing season length increased to reach maximum values at about 10?13?$\,^{\circ}$C of annual temperature according to the population. 4.?Since the magnitude of phenological plasticity is high for all the tested populations, they are likely to respond immediately to temperature variations in terms of leaf phenology. Consequently the mid- to high-elevation populations are likely to experience a longer growing season with climate warming. The results suggest that climate warming could lengthen the growing season of all populations over the altitudinal gradient, although the low-elevation populations, especially of beech, may experience accelerated senescence and shorter growing season due to drought and other climate changes associated with warming.},

@article{Diggle1995,
	Abstract = {{$[$}The commonly observed proximal-to-distal decrease within inflorescences of fruit and/or seed maturation per flower has frequently been attributed to competition among developing fruits for resources. The research summarized in this review suggests, however, that the observed variation can also be due to architecture--that is, to sources of variation inherent in plant axes. Thus, the fate of a developing flower depends not only on the reproductive events that have preceded it during the ontogeny of the organism, but on where it occurs within the architecture of an individual. The effects of architecture are separable experimentally from the effects of differential resource allocation, and careful experimental analysis of these two factors will enhance our understanding of the physiological, developmental, and evolutionary controls of fruit and seed production in flowering plants.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Organisms'life cycles consist of hierarchical stages, from a single phenological stage (for example, flowering within a season), to vegetative and reproductive phases, to the total lifespan of the individual. Yet phenological events are typically studied in isolation, limiting our understanding of life history responses to climate change. Here, we reciprocally transfer plant communities along an elevation gradient to investigate plastic changes in the duration of sequential phenological events for six alpine species. We show that prolonged flowering leads to longer reproductive phases and activity periods when plants are moved to warmer locations. In contrast, shorter post-fruiting leaf and flowering stages led to shorter vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively, which resulted in shorter activity periods when plants were moved to cooler conditions. Therefore, phenological responses to warming and cooling do not simply mirror one another in the opposite direction, and low temperature may limit reproductive allocation in the alpine region.},

@article{Zhang2017,
	Abstract = {Water stress is known to cause xylem cavitation in the leaves, roots and stems of plants, but little is known about the vulnerability of flowers to xylem damage during drought. This is an important gap in our understanding of how and when plants become damaged by water stress. Here we address fundamental questions about if and when flowers suffer cavitation damage, using a new technique of cavitation imaging to resolve the timing of cavitation in water-stressed flower petals compared with neighbouring leaves. Leaves and flowers from a sample of two herbaceous and two woody eudicots were exposed to a severe water stress while the spatial and temporal propagation of embolism through veins was recorded. Although in most cases water potentials inducing 50% embolism of herbaceous flower veins were more negative than neighbouring leaves, there was no significant difference between the average vulnerability of leaves and petals of herbaceous species. In both woody species, petals were more vulnerable to cavitation than leaves, in one case by more than 3 MPa. Early cavitation and subsequent damage of flowers in the two woody species would thus be expected to precede leaf damage during drought. Similar cavitation thresholds of flowers and leaves in the herb sample suggest that cavitation during water shortage in these species will occur simultaneously among aerial tissues. Species-specific differences in the cavitation thresholds of petals provide a new axis of variation that may explain contrasting flowering ecology among plant species.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the early flower phenology in temperate oak species promotes stochasticity into their fruiting dynamics, which could play a major role in tree reproductive success. From a large field monitoring network, we compared the pollen phenology between temperate and Mediterranean oak species. Then, focusing on temperate oak species, we explored the influence of the weather around the time of budburst and flowering on seed production, and simulated with a mechanistic model the consequences that an evolutionary shifting of flower phenology would have on fruiting dynamics. Temperate oak species release pollen earlier in the season than do Mediterranean oak species. Such early flowering in temperate oak species results in pollen often being released during unfavorable weather conditions and frequently results in reproductive failure. If pollen release were delayed as a result of natural selection, fruiting dynamics would exhibit much reduced stochastic variation. We propose that early flower phenology might be adaptive by making mast-seeding years rare and unpredictable, which would greatly help in controlling the dynamics of seed consumers.},

	Abstract = {Leaf phenology is a major driver of ecosystem functioning in temperate forests and a robust indicator of climate change. Both the inter-annual and inter-population variability of leaf phenology have received much attention in the literature; in contrast, the within-population variability of leaf phenology has been far less studied. Beyond its impact on individual tree physiological processes, the within-population variability of leaf phenology can affect the estimation of the average budburst or leaf senescence dates at the population scale. Here, we monitored the progress of spring and autumn leaf phenology over 14 tree populations (9 tree species) in six European forests over the period of 2011 to 2018 (yielding 16 site-years of data for spring, 14 for autumn). We monitored 27 to 512 (with a median of 62) individuals per population. We quantified the within-population variability of leaf phenology as the standard deviation of the distribution of individual dates of budburst or leaf senescence (SDBBi and SDLSi, respectively). Given the natural variability of phenological dates occurring in our tree populations, we estimated from the data that a minimum sample size of 28 (resp. 23) individuals, are required to estimate SDBBi (resp. SDLSi) with a precision of 3 (resp. 7) days. The within-population of leaf senescence (average SDLSi = 8.5 days) was on average two times larger than for budburst (average SDBBi = 4.0 days). We evidenced that warmer temperature during the budburst period and a late average budburst date were associated with a lower SDBBi, as a result of a quicker spread of budburst in tree populations, with a strong species effect. Regarding autumn phenology, we observed that later senescence and warm temperatures during the senescence period were linked with a high SDLSi, with a strong species effect. The shares of variance explained by our models were modest suggesting that other factors likely influence the within-population variation in leaf phenology. For instance, a detailed analysis revealed that summer temperatures were negatively correlated with a lower SDLSi.},

Leaf water potential at turgor loss, or wilting (πtlp), is classically recognised as a major physiological determinant of plant water stress response. However, the cellular basis of πtlp and its importance for predicting ecological drought tolerance have been controversial. A meta-analysis of 317 species from 72 studies showed that πtlp was strongly correlated with water availability within and across biomes, indicating power for anticipating drought responses. We derived new equations giving both πtlp and relative water content at turgor loss point (RWCtlp) as explicit functions of osmotic potential at full turgor (πo) and bulk modulus of elasticity (ε). Sensitivity analyses and meta-analyses showed that πo is the major driver of πtlp. In contrast, εplays no direct role in driving drought tolerance within or across species, but sclerophylly and elastic adjustments act to maintain RWCtlp, preventing cell dehydration, and additionally protect against nutrient, mechanical and herbivory stresses independent of drought tolerance. These findings clarify biogeographic trends and the underlying basis of drought tolerance parameters with applications in comparative assessments of species and ecosystems worldwide.},

	Abstract = {The supra-annual mast fruiting of dipterocarps, dominant trees of Far Eastern lowland rain forests, has been considered an adaptation to reduce seed predation through satiation. However, this explanation raises four important questions. (1) What pollinates species that flower at intervals of more than one year? (2) How do mass-flowering species avoid competition for pollinators? (3) What is the environmental cue for floral induction that induces scores of species in several families to flower at irregular intervals of more than one year in an aseasonal climate? (4) And, most important, what factors could cause an initial phenological aggregation of species' fruiting times? Once such a phenological core of species exists, selection for predator satiation could entrain other species into the same fruiting schedule and perfect the synchrony of seed release. The essential question is how such a phenological core of species, flowering at irregular intervals in an aseasonal climate, could initially arise. The observations and analyses presented here indicate that the answers to these questions are intricately related to each other and to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. (1) Several mass-flowering dipterocarps are pollinated by thrips, which persist at low levels between mass flowerings and can explode in density as the dipterocarps come into flower. (2) Mass-flowering dipterocarp species in Shorea section Mutica significantly reduce the overlap in flowering times by staggering their flowering periods, thereby reducing competition for pollinators and/or the clogging of stigmas with foreign pollen. The new technique used to analyze whether a particular pattern of resource use significantly reduces overlap overcomes an error inherent in previous techniques, and it should be used whenever the total flowering season or range of resources is determined not by external conditions, but by the range of flowering times or resources used by the species in question. (3) The time of floral induction in Shorea section Mutica is derived using the linear relationship between the duration of each species' flowering period and mean flowering date. An analysis of meteorological records suggests that induction is caused by a drop of roughly 2{\$}\^{}{$\backslash$}circ{\$}C or more in minimum nighttime temperature for three or more nights. This extraordinary trigger is probably the most reliable signal associated with an invasion of the aseasonal tropics by a dry air mass. (4) Such a trigger does not appear to be directly adaptive in the aseasonal tropics, but in the seasonal tropics it would result in flowering at the onset of dry season and ripening fruits at the beginning of rainy season. This suggests that the Dipterocarpaceae may have arisen initially in the seasonal tropics, even though their center of species diversity is now in the aseasonal tropics. Invasion of the aseasonal tropics by trees having such a floral trigger, adapted to the seasonal tropics, could help explain the origin of a phenological core of species flowering and fruiting more or less synchronously at intervals of several years. The droughts causing these mass flowerings may, in some cases, be driven by the climatic effects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the western Pacific, as evidenced by the temporal association of El Nino years with drought and mast fruiting on windward slopes of tropical Malesia.},

	N2 = {Abstract Our understanding of the factors that shape reproductive phenology in Southeast Asian tropical forests comes almost exclusively from studies of everwet, general flowering (GF) forests. Therefore, we examined the phenology of an evergreen dipterocarp forest in a climate exhibiting seasonal drought in Southeast Asia, with the aim of evaluating what evidence it brings to bear on the hypothesis that reproductive phenology in contemporary dipterocarp forests is the product of evolutionarily conserved responses to seasonal drought. We hypothesized that (1) dipterocarp forests that experience seasonal drought would exhibit annual reproduction and seasonality similar to that of forests with similar climates in other parts of the world, (2) within species, flowering frequency would be climate-dependent, not a fixed trait, and (3) climatic events that cue flowering in everwet forests would also cue flowering in seasonally dry forests. From 2001 to 2009, we monitored flowering and fruiting monthly for 1,344 trees (>300 spp.) in a forest in Khao Chong (KC), Thailand that experiences an annual 2?4 month dry season, assessing frequency, duration, seasonality and synchrony of reproduction. We also examined phenological records for trees in three dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet climates. Reproductive phenology of the KC forest was more similar to tropical forests with similar rainfall seasonality in other parts of the world than it was to dipterocarp-dominated forests in everwet regions of Southeast Asia. The forest exhibited annual reproduction, with peak flowering occurring at the end of the dry season and peak fruiting occurring early in the wet season. Approximately half of all species and individuals reproduced annually, including several species that are known to exhibit ?general flowering? in everwet climates. Short dry spells appeared to cue flowering for early flowering species, while later flowering species may have responded to either low precipitation or temperature, consistent with data from everwet forests. GF behaviour also showed significant phylogenetic signal. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the phenological behaviour of both seasonal and everwet dipterocarp forests may have initially evolved in response to seasonal drought and that the general flowering phenomenon is a product of evolutionary conservatism.},

@article{Revell2008,
	Abstract = {A recent advance in the phylogenetic comparative analysis of continuous traits has been explicit, model-based measurement of ``phylogenetic signal''in data sets composed of observations collected from species related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal (due to the resulting high resemblance between related species). In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift, there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal. For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating selection, niche conservatism, and evolutionary heterogeneity, the relationship between process, rate, and phylogenetic signal is complex. For these reasons, we recommend against interpretations of evolutionary process or rate based on estimates of phylogenetic signal.},

@article{Savage2013,
	Abstract = {{$[$}With increasing concern about the ecological consequences of global climate change, there has been renewed interest in understanding the processes that determine species range limits. We tested a long-hypothesized trade-off between freezing tolerance and growth rate that is often used to explain species range limits. We grew 24 willow and poplar species (family Salicaceae) collected from across North America in a greenhouse common garden under two climate treatments. Maximum entropy models were used to describe species distributions and to estimate species-specific climate parameters. A range of traits related to freezing tolerance, including senescence, budburst, and susceptibility to different temperature minima during and after acclimation were measured. As predicted, species from colder climates exhibited higher freezing tolerance and slower growth rates than species from warmer climates under certain environmental conditions. However, the average relative growth rate (millimeters per meter per day) of northern species markedly increased when a subset of species was grown under a long summer day length (20.5 h), indicating that genetically based day-length cues are required for growth regulation in these species. We conclude that the observed relationship between freezing tolerance and growth rate is not driven by differences in species' intrinsic growth capacity but by differences in the environmental cues that trigger growth. We propose that the coordinated evolution of freezing tolerance and growth phenology could be important in circumscribing willow and poplar range limits and may have important implications for species' current and future distributions.{$]$}},

	N2 = {ABSTRACT Aim? To analyse the global patterns in species richness of Viperidae snakes through the deconstruction of richness into sets of species according to their distribution models, range size, body size and phylogenetic structure, and to test if environmental drivers explaining the geographical ranges of species are similar to those explaining richness patterns, something we called the extreme deconstruction principle. Location? Global. Methods? We generated a global dataset of 228 terrestrial viperid snakes, which included geographical ranges (mapped at 1$\,^{\circ}$resolution, for a grid with 7331 cells world-wide), body sizes and phylogenetic relationships among species. We used logistic regression (generalized linear model; GLM) to model species geographical ranges with five environmental predictors. Sets of species richness were also generated for large and small-bodied species, for basal and derived species and for four classes of geographical range sizes. Richness patterns were also modelled against the five environmental variables through standard ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regressions. These subsets are replications to test if environmental factors driving species geographical ranges can be directly associated with those explaining richness patterns. Results? Around 48{\%} of the total variance in viperid richness was explained by the environmental model, but richness sets revealed different patterns across the world. The similarity between OLS coefficients and the primacy of variables across species geographical range GLMs was equal to 0.645 when analysing all viperid snakes. Thus, in general, when an environmental predictor it is important to model species geographical ranges, this predictor is also important when modelling richness, so that the extreme deconstruction principle holds. However, replicating this correlation using subsets of species within different categories in body size, range size and phylogenetic structure gave more variable results, with correlations between GLM and OLS coefficients varying from ?0.46 up to 0.83. Despite this, there is a relatively high correspondence (r = 0.73) between the similarity of GLM-OLS coefficients and R2 values of richness models, indicating that when richness is well explained by the environment, the relative importance of environmental drivers is similar in the richness OLS and its corresponding set of GLMs. Main conclusions? The deconstruction of species richness based on macroecological traits revealed that, at least for range size and phylogenetic level, the causes underlying patterns in viperid richness differ for the various sets of species. On the other hand, our analyses of extreme deconstruction using GLM for species geographical range support the idea that, if environmental drivers determine the geographical distribution of species by establishing niche boundaries, it is expected, at least in theory, that the overlap among ranges (i.e. richness) will reveal similar effects of these environmental drivers. Richness patterns may be indeed viewed as macroecological consequences of population-level processes acting on species geographical ranges.},

	N2 = {Shifts in the timing of species interactions are often cited as a consequence of climate change and, if present, are expected to have wide-reaching implications for ecological communities. Our knowledge about these shifts mostly comes from single systems, which have provided no clear picture, thus limiting our understanding of how species interactions may be responding overall. Using a new global database based on long-term data on the seasonal timing of biological events for pairwise species interactions, we find that the relative timing of interacting species has changed substantially in recent decades. The observed shifts are greater in magnitude than before recent climate change began, suggesting that there will be widespread warming-related shifts in the synchrony of species in the future.Phenological responses to climate change (e.g., earlier leaf-out or egg hatch date) are now well documented and clearly linked to rising temperatures in recent decades. Such shifts in the phenologies of interacting species may lead to shifts in their synchrony, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences. To date, single-system studies have provided no clear picture, either finding synchrony shifts may be extremely prevalent {$[$}Mayor SJ, et al. (2017) Sci Rep 7:1902{$]$} or relatively uncommon {$[$}Iler AM, et al. (2013) Glob Chang Biol 19:2348--2359{$]$}, suggesting that shifts toward asynchrony may be infrequent. A meta-analytic approach would provide insights into global trends and how they are linked to climate change. We compared phenological shifts among pairwise species interactions (e.g., predator--prey) using published long-term time-series data of phenological events from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems across four continents since 1951 to determine whether recent climate change has led to overall shifts in synchrony. We show that the relative timing of key life cycle events of interacting species has changed significantly over the past 35 years. Further, by comparing the period before major climate change (pre-1980s) and after, we show that estimated changes in phenology and synchrony are greater in recent decades. However, there has been no consistent trend in the direction of these changes. Our findings show that there have been shifts in the timing of interacting species in recent decades; the next challenges are to improve our ability to predict the direction of change and understand the full consequences for communities and ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {{$[$}The strength of phylogenetic signal in extinction risk can give insight into the mechanisms behind species' declines. Nevertheless, no existing measure of phylogenetic pattern in a binary trait, such as extinctionrisk status, measures signal strength in a way that can be compared among data sets. We developed a new measure f or phylogenetic signal of binary traits, D, which simulations show gives robust results with data sets of more than 50 species, even when the proportion of threatened species is low. We applied D to the red-list status of British birds and the world's mammals and found that the threat status for both groups exhibited moderately strong phylogenetic clumping. We also tested the hypothesis that the phylogenetic pattern of species threatened by harvesting will be more strongly clumped than for those species threatened by either habitat loss or invasive species because the life-history traits mediating the effects of harvesting show strong evolutionary pattern. For mammals, our results supported our hypothesis; there was significant but weaker phylogenetic signal in the risk caused by the other two drivers (habitat loss and invasive species). We conclude that D is likely to be a useful measure of the strength of phylogenetic pattern in many binary traits.

	N2 = {In its simplest definition, a trait is a surrogate of organismal performance, and this meaning of the term has been used by evolutionists for a long time. Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term ?trait? itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the ?performance paradigm? to plant ecology. ?Functional traits? are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing ?integration functions? which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.},

Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.},

Despite a recent surge of interest in the phenomenon, especially in phylogenetic histories of radiations, we know too little about the ecology of most radiations to assess the roles of the three processes.

	N2 = {Abstract Measures of the seasonal timing of biological events are key to addressing questions about how phenology evolves, modifies species interactions, and mediates biological responses to climate change. Phenology is often characterized in terms of discrete events, such as a date of first flowering or arrival of first migrants. We discuss how phenological events that are typically measured at the population or species level arise from distributions of phenological events across seasons, and from norms of reaction of these phenological events across environments. We argue that individual variation in phenological distributions and reaction norms has important implications for how we should collect, analyze, and interpret phenological information. Regarding phenology as a reaction norm rather than one year's specific values implies that selection acts on the phenologies that an individual expresses over its lifetime. To understand how climate change is likely to influence phenology, we need to consider not only plastic responses along the reaction norm but changes in the reaction norm itself. We show that when individuals vary in their reaction norms, correlations between reaction norm elevation and slope make first events particularly poor estimators of population sensitivity to climate change, and variation in slopes can obscure the pattern of selection on phenology. We also show that knowing the shape of the distribution of phenological events across the season is important for predicting biologically important phenological mismatches with climate change. Last, because phenological events are parts of a continuous developmental process, we suggest that the approach of measuring phenology by recording developmental stages of individuals in a population at a single point in time should be used more widely. We conclude that failure to account for phenological distributions and reaction norms may lead to overinterpretation of metrics based on single events, such as commonly recorded first event dates, and may confound meta-analyses that use a range of metrics. Rather than prescribing a single universal approach to studying phenology, we point out limitations of inferences based on single metrics and encourage work that considers the multivariate nature of phenology and more tightly links data collection and analyses with biological hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {{To provide a theoretical basis for developing intensive cultivation
   practices for Populus tomentosa plantations, the leaf phenology
   variation within the canopy and its relationship with transpiration of
   well-watered P. tomentosa tree in a dense plantation were investigated.
   The variation in canopy light interception, indicated by the ratio
   between net radiation under (Rn-u) and above (Rn-a) canopy, with leaf
   development was also studied. During the growing season, the achievement
   of maximum leaf number tended to be later in higher parts of the canopy.
   In the lower and middle canopy, the leaf number maximized earlier in the
   east-facing side than in the west-facing side, but this difference
   disappeared in the upper canopy. The Rn-u/Rn-a was stable in May, but
   declined and then varied steadily until late August. Generally, in May,
   the crop coefficient (K-cb) of the tree reached its highest level and
   was not correlated with leaf area (LA) in all layers (p > 0.05).
   However, it increased linearly (p < 0.001) with LA in the layers above a
   canopy height of 3 m from June to late August, and most of its variation
   was explained by LA in the 5-7 m layer. After late August, K-cb
   decreased linearly with decreasing LA in all layers (p < 0.001).
   Consequently, a temporal ecological strategy seems to be adopted by P.
   tomentosa leaves in different layers and azimuthal sides for efficient
   light acquisition. The contribution of the different canopy layers to
   tree transpiration can vary, with the leaves in the upper and all layers
   mainly controlling transpiration in summer and in spring and autumn,
   respectively.}},

	Abstract = {{Bud-burst, leaf area index (LAI), transpiration, soil water content and
   radial growth of a 35-year-old Quercus petraea stand were measured
   during 5 successive years (1989-1993). At the beginning of 1992, half of
   the stand was thinned. The increase of stand transpiration during spring
   was linearly correlated to the development of LAI. During the second
   part of the season, although LAI continued to increase because of
   rhythmic shoot development, transpiration was strongly reduced as soil
   water content decreased. The transpiration/potential evapotranspiration
   (T/PET) ratio decreased sharply as soon as relative extractable water
   (REW) dropped below 0.4. Likewise, cumulated stand transpiration varied
   among years because of variability in soil water availability, LAI and
   canopy structure. A linear relationship, similar to the one observed for
   weekly variations, was noted between T/PET and LAI; maximum LAI ranged
   from 3.3 to 6 in this ring-porous species. Seasonal circumference
   measurements showed that 43\% of the annual increment was achieved
   before leaf development, hence before canopy transpiration and CO2
   assimilation were started. Tree ring area was significantly correlated
   to the cumulated transpiration; a water-use efficiency variable was
   defined at both tree and stand level.}},

	Abstract = {{P>Flowering times of plants are important life-history components and it
   has previously been hypothesized that flowering phenologies may be
   currently subject to natural selection or be selectively neutral. In
   this study we reviewed the evidence for phenotypic selection acting on
   flowering phenology using ordinary and phylogenetic meta-analysis.
   Phenotypic selection exists when a phenotypic trait co-varies with
   fitness; therefore, we looked for studies reporting an association
   between two components of flowering phenology (flowering time or
   flowering synchrony) with fitness. Data sets comprising 87 and 18 plant
   species were then used to assess the incidence and strength of
   phenotypic selection on flowering time and flowering synchrony,
   respectively. The influence of dependence on pollinators, the duration
   of the reproductive event, latitude and plant longevity as moderators of
   selection were also explored. Our results suggest that selection favours
   early flowering plants, but the strength of selection is influenced by
   latitude, with selection being stronger in temperate environments.
   However, there is no consistent pattern of selection on flowering
   synchrony. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic selection on flowering
   time is consistent and relatively strong, in contrast to previous
   hypotheses of selective neutrality, and has implications for the
   evolution of temperate floras under global climate change.}},

In contrast, after successive years of vegetative growth at early ages, woody perennial shoot meristems begin repeated transitions between vegetative and reproductive growth at sexual maturity. However, it is unknown how these repeated transitions occur without a developmental conflict between vegetative and reproductive growth. We report that functionally diverged paralogs FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) and FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (FT2), products of whole-genome duplication and homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), coordinate the repeated cycles of vegetative and reproductive growth in woody perennial poplar (Populus spp.). Our manipulative physiological and genetic experiments coupled with field studies, expression profiling, and network analysis reveal that reproductive onset is determined by FT1 in response to winter temperatures, whereas vegetative growth and inhibition of bud set are promoted by FT2 in response to warm temperatures and long days in the growing season. The basis for functional differentiation between FT1 and FT2 appears to be expression pattern shifts, changes in proteins, and divergence in gene regulatory networks. Thus, temporal separation of reproductive onset and vegetative growth into different seasons via FT1 and FT2 provides seasonality and demonstrates the evolution of a complex perennial adaptive trait after genome duplication.},

@article{Lamont2011,
	Abstract = {Data on 386 species with fire-stimulated flowering (fsf) in Australasia and South Africa/Madagascar were collated to show that they occur under a wide range of fire regimes, with 71{\%} confined to the mediterranean-climate regions. About 40{\%} only flower up to 2 years after fire (obligate), while the rest continue at a low rate until the next fire (facultative). Peak flowering occurs 5--18 months after fire in the mediterranean regions but at 1--7 months in savannas. Fsf is recorded in 34 families, headed by terrestrial orchids (45{\%} of species), spread throughout the seed-plant phylogeny from cycads to daisies. Tuberous geophytes (essentially orchids) dominate (51{\%}), but other resprouting growth forms include lignotuberous shrubs and forbs, rhizomatous and bunch grasses, leaf succulents, grasstrees, epicormic trees, and hemiparasites. Most have wind-dispersed diaspores (72{\%}), store their diaspores in the soil (93{\%}), and seeds that do not germinate until the next fire (72{\%}). Fsf in association with resprouting takes advantage of optimal resources and minimal competition for growth and reproduction, conditions that favor wind dispersal and maximize the interval for seed accumulation before the next fire and build-up of fire-tolerant organs. Reduced herbivory has little role in accounting for its benefits. The proximal causes of fsf center around cueing factors (direct effects such as ethylene), resource factors (direct and indirect effects, e.g., extra nutrients), and predisposing factors (circumstantial effects, e.g., fire interval). The evolutionary history of fsf has been explored recently in orchids, proteas, blood roots, droseras, and mistletoes and shown to stretch back over a period of at least 50 million years, indicating that flowering in many groups has a long association with fire as an agent of natural selection.},

At least 10 {\%} of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.Scope and ConclusionsWind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

	Abstract = {We are now reaching the stage at which specific genetic factors with known physiological effects can be tied directly and quantitatively to variation in phenology. With such a mechanistic understanding, scientists can better predict phenological responses to novel seasonal climates. Using the widespread model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we explore how variation in different genetic pathways can be linked to phenology and life-history variation across geographical regions and seasons. We show that the expression of phenological traits including flowering depends critically on the growth season, and we outline an integrated life-history approach to phenology in which the timing of later life-history events can be contingent on the environmental cues regulating earlier life stages. As flowering time in many plants is determined by the integration of multiple environmentally sensitive gene pathways, the novel combinations of important seasonal cues in projected future climates will alter how phenology responds to variation in the flowering time gene network with important consequences for plant life history. We discuss how phenology models in other systems--both natural and agricultural--could employ a similar framework to explore the potential contribution of genetic variation to the physiological integration of cues determining phenology.},

	N2 = {Summary Accurate predictions of spring plant phenology with climate change are critical for projections of growing seasons, plant communities and a number of ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Progress towards prediction, however, has been slow because the major cues known to drive phenology ? temperature (including winter chilling and spring forcing) and photoperiod ? generally covary in nature and may interact, making accurate predictions of plant responses to climate change complex and nonlinear. Alternatively, recent work suggests many species may be dominated by one cue, which would make predictions much simpler. Here, we manipulated all three cues across 28 woody species from two North American forests. All species responded to all cues examined. Chilling exerted a strong effect, especially on budburst (?15.8 d), with responses to forcing and photoperiod greatest for leafout (?19.1 and ?11.2 d, respectively). Interactions between chilling and forcing suggest that each cue may compensate somewhat for the other. Cues varied across species, leading to staggered leafout within each community and supporting the idea that phenology is a critical aspect of species' temporal niches. Our results suggest that predicting the spring phenology of communities will be difficult, as all species we studied could have complex, nonlinear responses to future warming.},

@article{Piao2007,
	Abstract = {A number of studies have suggested that the growing season duration has significantly lengthened during the past decades, but the connections between phenology variability and the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are far from clear. In this study, we used the ``ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems'' (ORCHIDEE) process based ecosystem model together with observed climate data to investigate spatiotemporal changes in phenology and their impacts on carbon fluxes in the Northern Hemisphere (>25$\,^{\circ}$N) during 1980--2002. We found that the growing season length (GSL) has increased by 0.30 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.27, P = 0.010), owing to the combination of an earlier onset in spring (0.16 days yr−1) and a later termination in autumn (0.14 days yr−1). Trends in the GSL are however highly variable across the regions. In Eurasia, there is a significant trend toward earlier vegetation green-up with an overall advancement rate of 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.32, P = 0.005), while in North America there is a significantly delayed vegetation senescence by 0.28 days yr−1 (R2 = 0.26, P = 0.013) during the study period. Our results also suggested that the GSL strongly correlates with annual gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP), indicating that longer growing seasons may eventually enhance vegetation growth. A 1-day extension in GSL leads to an increase in annual GPP of 5.8 gC m−2 yr−1 (or 0.6\% per day), and an increase in NPP of 2.8 gC m−2 yr−1 per day. However, owing to enhanced soil carbon decomposition accompanying the GPP increase, a change in GSL correlates only poorly with a change in annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP).},

	N2 = {Abstract Aim Closely related species tend to resemble each other in their morphology and ecology because of shared ancestry. When exploring correlations between species traits, therefore, species cannot be treated as statistically independent. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) attempt to correct statistically for this shared evolutionary history. Almost all such approaches, however, assume that correlations between traits are constant across the tips of the tree, which we refer to as phylogenetic stationarity. We suggest that this assumption of phylogenetic stationarity might be often violated and that relationships between species traits might evolve alongside clades, for example, owing to the effects of unmeasured traits or other latent variables. Specific examples range from shifts in allometric scaling relationships between clades (e.g., basal metabolic rate and body mass in endotherms, and tree diameter and biomass in trees) to the differing relationship between leaf mass per area and shade tolerance in deciduous versus evergreen trees and shrubs. Innovation Here, we introduce an exploratory modelling framework, phylogenetically weighted regression, which represents an extension of geographically weighted regression (GWR) used in spatial studies, to allow non-stationarity in model parameters across a phylogenetic tree. We demonstrate our approach using empirical data on flowering time and seed mass from a well-studied plant community in southeastern Sweden. Our model reveals strong, diverging trends across the phylogeny, including changes in the sign of the relationship between clades. Main conclusions By allowing for phylogenetic non-stationarity, we are able to detect shifting relationships among species traits that would be obscured in traditional PCMs; thus, we suggest that PWR might be an important exploratory tool in the search for key missing variables in comparative analyses.},

@article{Bolmgren2003,
	Abstract = {Abstract Biotic pollination is thought to correlate with increased interspecific competition for pollination among plants and a higher speciation rate. In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.},

	Abstract = {A number of morphologic features have evolved in evolutionarily divergent plant groups that appear to increase the efficiency of wind pollination. Among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains, female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles, and population structures with a high density of con-specifics. This paper reviews the aerodynamic theory, and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs. The efficiency of wind pollination is shown to be dictated principally by the vectoral properties of air currents created by and around ovulate organs and the physical properties of pollen that dictate their behavior as airborne particles. /// Eine Anzahl von morphologischen Kennzeichen, die Effizienz der Windpollination zu steigern scheinen, haben sich in evolution\&{\#}xe4;r ausenandergehonden Pflanzengruppen entwickelt.

	Abstract = {{Premise of the Study New growth in the spring requires resource
   mobilization in the vascular system at a time when xylem and phloem
   function are often reduced in seasonally cold climates. As a result, the
   timing of leaf out and/or flowering could depend on when the vascular
   system resumes normal function in the spring. This study investigated
   whether flowering time is influenced by vascular phenology in plants
   that flower precociously before they have leaves. Methods Flower, leaf,
   and vascular phenology were monitored in pairs of precocious and
   non-precocious congeners. Differences in resource allocation were
   quantified by measuring bud dry mass and water content throughout the
   year, floral hydration was modelled, and a girdling treatment completed
   on branches in the field. Key Results Precocious flowering species
   invested more in floral buds the year before flowering than did their
   non-precocious congeners, thus mobilizing less water in the spring,
   which allowed flowering before new vessel maturation. Conclusions A
   shift in the timing of resource allocation in precocious flowering
   plants allowed them to flower before the production of mature vessels
   and minimized the significance of seasonal changes in vascular function
   to their flowering phenology. The low investment required to complete
   floral development in the spring when the plant vascular system is often
   compromised could explain why flowers can emerge before leaf out.}},

	Abstract = {{Today, angiosperms are fundamental players in the diversity and
   biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Yet despite the omnipresence
   of angiosperms in today's ecosystems, the basic evolutionary
   understanding of how the earliest angiosperms functioned remains
   unknown. Here we synthesize ecophysiological, paleobotanical,
   paleoecological, and phylogenetic lines of evidence about early
   angiosperms and their environments. In doing so, we arrive at a
   hypothesis that early angiosperms evolved in evermoist tropical
   terrestrial habitats, where three of their emblematic innovations -
   including net-veined leaves, xylem vessels, and flowers - found
   ecophysiological advantages. However, the adaptation of early angiosperm
   ecophysiology to wet habitats did not initially promote massive
   diversification and ecological dominance. Instead, wet habitats were
   permissive for the ecological roothold of the clade, a critical phase of
   early diversification that entailed experimentation with a range of
   functional innovations in the leaves, wood, and flowers. Later, our
   results suggest that some of these innovations were co-opted gradually
   for new roles in the evolution of greater productivity and drought
   tolerance, which are characteristics seen across the vast majority of
   derived and ecologically dominant angiosperms today.}},

@article{Milleron2012,
	Abstract = {{The effect of non-reproductive trees and saplings as a physical barrier
   to pollen dispersal in wind-pollinated species' forests has not received
   enough attention in the literature so far. The neighborhood seedling
   model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different
   stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as
   a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological
   overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind
   directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a
   mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The
   ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by
   seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species
   (Quercus petraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last,
   to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first
   plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for
   recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting
   the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to
   pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination
   directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic
   winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech
   pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed,
   enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen
   dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of
   canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf
   phenology of co-occurring species in the forest.}},

@article{Nathan2005,
	Abstract = {{Seed terminal velocity and release height are recognized as key biotic
   determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet,
   potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics
   in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received
   much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and
   experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how
   seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by leaf-area index
   (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model,
   previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also
   reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics for a
   wide range of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more
   organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to
   higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are
   also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that
   former effect more than compensates for the latter, i.e., conditions of
   low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many
   temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring
   or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals
   that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD
   of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed terminal velocity.
   Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for
   distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its
   results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density
   dynamics.}},

@article{Whitehead1969,
	Abstract = {Studies of the aerodynamics of particle transport and capture suggest that the conditions most propitious for effective wind pollination are as follows: (1) production and release of large numbers of grains; (2) both anthers and stigma exposed; (3) grains falling within a certain size range (20-40\&{\#}x3bc;); very small grains will be dispersed readily but cannot be captured efficiently by the stigma, large grains have a high terminal velocity, hence will settle too rapidly; (4) exine of grains thin (or with large air spaces), sculpture smooth; (5) the stigma should present much surface area to capture grains, but, since collection efficiency will decrease with increasing stigma diameter, the increase in surface should be accomplished through the evolution of a complex stigma with many branches of small diameter; (6) individuals of the species should not be too widely spaced in the vegetation; (7) the vegetation should be open in structure or deciduous; thus there will be few obstructions to transport during at least one portion of the year; (8) flowering must be closely coordinated by relatively unambiguous environmental stimuli; (9) pollen release (hence flowering) should coincide with the most favorable time of the year for transport (low probability of precipitation, adequate winds and turbulence, deciduous season). The geography of wind pollination in the angiosperms can be understood best in terms of these prerequisites for efficient transport of pollen. Anemophily is very infrequent in the tropical rain forest, becomes more frequent as one moves to more seasonally variable environments, and is frequent in northern temperate forests. The environment of the tropical rain forest is unsuitable for anemophily: (1) species diversity is very high, hence individuals of the same species are apt to be widely spaced; (2) the forest is densely structured, hence wind velocities are low and there are many obstacles to transport; (3) there is no leafless season; (4) rainfall is frequent throughout the year, hence transport will be limited; (5) there are few unambiguous stimuli which can coordinate flowering; (6) potential animal pollinators are abundant. These conditions do not exist in northern temperate forests, or in prairies, or in savannas. It is possible that the evolution of wind pollination in the angiosperms paralleled the evolution of the deciduous habit. Axelrod has suggested that the deciduous habit evolved in response to seasonal drought as angiosperms migrated into lower middle latitudes during the early Cretaceous. Both the deciduous habit and the physical conditions existing just peripheral to the tropics would favor the evolution of wind pollination. An examination of seasonal environments in the tropics at present and the fossil record of deciduous and wind pollinated angiosperms supports this contention.},
