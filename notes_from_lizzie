Notes from Lizzie chat Nov 15

Justify this concept paper biologically rather than just as a critique of the data.

Intro:
Commonness, hypotheses and climate change.


Current progress
list of motivating question questions

What structures and constrains variability? Cues and anatomy

Use Oak figure to describe inter indivudal, and annaul varaition. Imply that there might be popluation difference.
Also degree of ofset might be under different selction ie (4 days for 1 species vs 3 weeks for others)

How does incorperating variation help our understanding of hypotheses?

Figures:
1. Pep climate change
2. Quercus rubra
3a. Mich trees (run model full taxonomic w/o all predictors, run model full trait representation, run model with trait represented species but no the traits)
3b. Silvics( same as above)
3c. HF binary, HF continous

Traits: Gather: pollination syndrome, flowering time, Min P (USDA) minT (USDA.)
Take away, certain hypotheses seem generally supported across these methods. Others less so. WHat do we need to do to test them better esp. how continuous data helps.
