\section{Flower Leaf sequences}
\indent Phenology, the study of seasonal life cycle events, has long been studied, and recently drawn increasing scientific attention \citep{Wolkovich2014} Recent work is beginning to show that it is not only individual phenophases that are important, but also the realtionship between them, even if they are seemingly disperate \citep{Ettenger2018}.\\
\indent One phenological sequence that has begun to attract research attention is the flower leaf sequence (FLS) in deciduous woody plants\citep{Gogherty2018}. It has long been observed that in the temperate deciduous forests, some woody species flower before leafing in the spring, while others leafout before flowering. Flowering first, also know as hysteranthy, proteranthy or precocious flowering \citep{} is readily apparent in many ecologically and commercially important species and has been described as the characteristic flower-leaf sequence (FLS) of temperate deciduous forests \citep{Rathcke1985}. It has been suggested that FLS variation should be viewed as a functional trait, critical to the reproductive or physiological functioning of woody species \citep{Gougherty2018}, however direct empirical evidence for this assertion is rare in the literature.\\
\indent  In the past decades, pronounced shifts in phenology, driven by anthropogenic cliamte change, have already been observed across a broad range of taxa, with plant phenology shifting by 3-5 days on average per decade \citep{Parmesan2003,Menzel2006,Root2003}, but because the physiological mechanism structuring FLS's have been poorly characterized, it is difficult to predict if, or how observed phenological advances will affect FLS in the future. We analyzed two long term phenological datasets (HAFO and PEP), to evaluate the changes in FLS overtime. Our results indicate that climate change is already altering FLS patterns in a number of woody species beyound their historical range of variability (See figure 1).% How much method and explaination to I give here?
\indent Based on this, it is impertive we apply ourselves to better understand the function of FLS, to evaluate the affect of FLS change on plant demography or something
