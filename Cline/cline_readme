Cline read meUpdated March 28 2018

The purpose of this folder was to investigate whether there was a cline in degree of hysteranthy.
I used data from Pep725 database. And some NPN data, which was a little sparse.
They hypothesis was that if hysteranthy was a by-product of differential selection by late season frost, you would see a weaker amount of hysteranthy in the far south where late season frost was less prevelant. 

While there are slight trends, none of the patterns were terribly convincing. THis probably could be addressed using the data in a more thoughtful way--for example, geographic variation may be swamped interannual in the current method. 

However, this idea has been closed for now.
