There is a lot  of scratch in this repo, But here are the main things someone might want to know.

FLOBUDS is a folder for my chamber experiments, which deserves its own readme. 

Almost all of the the disparate parts of the main hysteranthy project have been condensed into the file 
"paper_full_analysis.R" in the Scripts Folder. 

"concept_paper_analysis.R" contains the phylglm models for MTSV and USFS data, but these models should eventually be replaced by a Stan version which should be coded directly into "paper_full_analysis.R"

the folder "writing" contains:
rethinking_FLS_draft.Rnw This is the main paper
outline.parII.Rnw is working outline to replace the second part of above draft.
main_takeaways.Rnw are the main takeways from the analysis.

I will update this to explain the data and cleaning soon, but this should get any collaborators going!
