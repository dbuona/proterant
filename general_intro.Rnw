Green is the color of spring, but any keen observer walking the temperate, deciduous forest of the Eastern United States in early would readily witness that it is often the subtle reds, and yellows of emerging tree flowers that are the first harbingers of the season in temperate forest communities. The tendency of some species to seasonally produce flowers before leaves, known as proteranthy(), is well doccumented in ecological literature(). Proteranthy has been described with several assosiative and explainatory hypothesizes including: proteranty is associated with wind pollination species (), gallery and overstory trees(), and provides a fitness advantage by allowing for more effecient pollination due to the absance of leaves as barriers to pollen transfer(). While these explainations appear logical, I cannot rule out the possibility that these hypothesizes are no more than "just so stories"(Gould), as I have found no evidence that any of these hypothesizes have ever been empirically investigated. Generally speaking, the study of phenology, or the annual timing of lifecycle events, has historically addressed floral and foliate phenophases seperately, and there has been little effort to integrate studies accross the two (Wolkovich and Ettinger). This means there are not only many unanswered questions about the prevelance and function of proteranthy, but a lack of knowledge about the nature of temporal relationships between floral and foliate phenophases in general. Foliate and floral phenophases are inherantly linked internally through resources allocation (), development () and <perhaps> genetic archatechture(), and if the adaptive hypothesis of proteranthy can be supported, externally through natural selection as well. Because of these relationships, scientists must undertake the studies that examine reproductive (floral) and productive (foliate) phenophases together to better understand observed phenological responses in nature.\\
A thorough examination of the nature and function of floral-foliate patterns is all the more important in our current global context of antrhpogenic climate change. Phenological shifts across a wide range of taxa have been observed as a response to changing climate conditions(), and it is well established that the species significantly differ in their ability to phenologicallytrack climate change (Wolkovich, cleland?). If in certain species, floral-foliate phenological patterns evolved under stable environmental conditions to confer fitness, disruptions to the sequence as a result of climate change could have negative demographic consequences. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that dictate floral-foliate phenological patterns, role those patterns play in the lifecycle and success of an organism is imperitive for predicting future forest community dynamics, structure and function in the warmer world of the near future.
