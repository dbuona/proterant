	N2 = {Abstract Aim Closely related species tend to resemble each other in their morphology and ecology because of shared ancestry. When exploring correlations between species traits, therefore, species cannot be treated as statistically independent. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) attempt to correct statistically for this shared evolutionary history. Almost all such approaches, however, assume that correlations between traits are constant across the tips of the tree, which we refer to as phylogenetic stationarity. We suggest that this assumption of phylogenetic stationarity might be often violated and that relationships between species traits might evolve alongside clades, for example, owing to the effects of unmeasured traits or other latent variables. Specific examples range from shifts in allometric scaling relationships between clades (e.g., basal metabolic rate and body mass in endotherms, and tree diameter and biomass in trees) to the differing relationship between leaf mass per area and shade tolerance in deciduous versus evergreen trees and shrubs. Innovation Here, we introduce an exploratory modelling framework, phylogenetically weighted regression, which represents an extension of geographically weighted regression (GWR) used in spatial studies, to allow non-stationarity in model parameters across a phylogenetic tree. We demonstrate our approach using empirical data on flowering time and seed mass from a well-studied plant community in southeastern Sweden. Our model reveals strong, diverging trends across the phylogeny, including changes in the sign of the relationship between clades. Main conclusions By allowing for phylogenetic non-stationarity, we are able to detect shifting relationships among species traits that would be obscured in traditional PCMs; thus, we suggest that PWR might be an important exploratory tool in the search for key missing variables in comparative analyses.},

@article{Bolmgren2003,
	Abstract = {Abstract Biotic pollination is thought to correlate with increased interspecific competition for pollination among plants and a higher speciation rate. In this study we compared patterns of flowering phenology and species richness between abiotically (wind) and biotically pollinated plants, using phylogenetically independent contrasts. We compiled phenological data from eight local seasonal floras, in which we found geographically overlapping sister clades. Of 65 documented origins of wind pollination, we were able to use up to 17 independent contrasts. In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes. These results corroborate previous views that niche space is more constrained for wind-pollinated species, and that niche partitioning is less important between wind-pollinated plants compared to plants pollinated by animals.},

	Abstract = {A number of morphologic features have evolved in evolutionarily divergent plant groups that appear to increase the efficiency of wind pollination. Among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains, female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles, and population structures with a high density of con-specifics. This paper reviews the aerodynamic theory, and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs. The efficiency of wind pollination is shown to be dictated principally by the vectoral properties of air currents created by and around ovulate organs and the physical properties of pollen that dictate their behavior as airborne particles. /// Eine Anzahl von morphologischen Kennzeichen, die Effizienz der Windpollination zu steigern scheinen, haben sich in evolution\&{\#}xe4;r ausenandergehonden Pflanzengruppen entwickelt.

	Abstract = {{Premise of the Study New growth in the spring requires resource
   mobilization in the vascular system at a time when xylem and phloem
   function are often reduced in seasonally cold climates. As a result, the
   timing of leaf out and/or flowering could depend on when the vascular
   system resumes normal function in the spring. This study investigated
   whether flowering time is influenced by vascular phenology in plants
   that flower precociously before they have leaves. Methods Flower, leaf,
   and vascular phenology were monitored in pairs of precocious and
   non-precocious congeners. Differences in resource allocation were
   quantified by measuring bud dry mass and water content throughout the
   year, floral hydration was modelled, and a girdling treatment completed
   on branches in the field. Key Results Precocious flowering species
   invested more in floral buds the year before flowering than did their
   non-precocious congeners, thus mobilizing less water in the spring,
   which allowed flowering before new vessel maturation. Conclusions A
   shift in the timing of resource allocation in precocious flowering
   plants allowed them to flower before the production of mature vessels
   and minimized the significance of seasonal changes in vascular function
   to their flowering phenology. The low investment required to complete
   floral development in the spring when the plant vascular system is often
   compromised could explain why flowers can emerge before leaf out.}},

	Abstract = {{Today, angiosperms are fundamental players in the diversity and
   biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Yet despite the omnipresence
   of angiosperms in today's ecosystems, the basic evolutionary
   understanding of how the earliest angiosperms functioned remains
   unknown. Here we synthesize ecophysiological, paleobotanical,
   paleoecological, and phylogenetic lines of evidence about early
   angiosperms and their environments. In doing so, we arrive at a
   hypothesis that early angiosperms evolved in evermoist tropical
   terrestrial habitats, where three of their emblematic innovations -
   including net-veined leaves, xylem vessels, and flowers - found
   ecophysiological advantages. However, the adaptation of early angiosperm
   ecophysiology to wet habitats did not initially promote massive
   diversification and ecological dominance. Instead, wet habitats were
   permissive for the ecological roothold of the clade, a critical phase of
   early diversification that entailed experimentation with a range of
   functional innovations in the leaves, wood, and flowers. Later, our
   results suggest that some of these innovations were co-opted gradually
   for new roles in the evolution of greater productivity and drought
   tolerance, which are characteristics seen across the vast majority of
   derived and ecologically dominant angiosperms today.}},

@article{Milleron2012,
	Abstract = {{The effect of non-reproductive trees and saplings as a physical barrier
   to pollen dispersal in wind-pollinated species' forests has not received
   enough attention in the literature so far. The neighborhood seedling
   model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different
   stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as
   a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological
   overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind
   directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a
   mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The
   ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by
   seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species
   (Quercus petraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last,
   to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first
   plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for
   recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting
   the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to
   pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination
   directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic
   winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech
   pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed,
   enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen
   dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of
   canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf
   phenology of co-occurring species in the forest.}},

@article{Nathan2005,
	Abstract = {{Seed terminal velocity and release height are recognized as key biotic
   determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet,
   potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics
   in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received
   much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and
   experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how
   seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by leaf-area index
   (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model,
   previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also
   reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics for a
   wide range of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more
   organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to
   higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are
   also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that
   former effect more than compensates for the latter, i.e., conditions of
   low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many
   temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring
   or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals
   that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD
   of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed terminal velocity.
   Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for
   distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its
   results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density
   dynamics.}},

@article{Whitehead1969,
	Abstract = {Studies of the aerodynamics of particle transport and capture suggest that the conditions most propitious for effective wind pollination are as follows: (1) production and release of large numbers of grains; (2) both anthers and stigma exposed; (3) grains falling within a certain size range (20-40\&{\#}x3bc;); very small grains will be dispersed readily but cannot be captured efficiently by the stigma, large grains have a high terminal velocity, hence will settle too rapidly; (4) exine of grains thin (or with large air spaces), sculpture smooth; (5) the stigma should present much surface area to capture grains, but, since collection efficiency will decrease with increasing stigma diameter, the increase in surface should be accomplished through the evolution of a complex stigma with many branches of small diameter; (6) individuals of the species should not be too widely spaced in the vegetation; (7) the vegetation should be open in structure or deciduous; thus there will be few obstructions to transport during at least one portion of the year; (8) flowering must be closely coordinated by relatively unambiguous environmental stimuli; (9) pollen release (hence flowering) should coincide with the most favorable time of the year for transport (low probability of precipitation, adequate winds and turbulence, deciduous season). The geography of wind pollination in the angiosperms can be understood best in terms of these prerequisites for efficient transport of pollen. Anemophily is very infrequent in the tropical rain forest, becomes more frequent as one moves to more seasonally variable environments, and is frequent in northern temperate forests. The environment of the tropical rain forest is unsuitable for anemophily: (1) species diversity is very high, hence individuals of the same species are apt to be widely spaced; (2) the forest is densely structured, hence wind velocities are low and there are many obstacles to transport; (3) there is no leafless season; (4) rainfall is frequent throughout the year, hence transport will be limited; (5) there are few unambiguous stimuli which can coordinate flowering; (6) potential animal pollinators are abundant. These conditions do not exist in northern temperate forests, or in prairies, or in savannas. It is possible that the evolution of wind pollination in the angiosperms paralleled the evolution of the deciduous habit. Axelrod has suggested that the deciduous habit evolved in response to seasonal drought as angiosperms migrated into lower middle latitudes during the early Cretaceous. Both the deciduous habit and the physical conditions existing just peripheral to the tropics would favor the evolution of wind pollination. An examination of seasonal environments in the tropics at present and the fossil record of deciduous and wind pollinated angiosperms supports this contention.},
